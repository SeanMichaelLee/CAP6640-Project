Traders' bets on the future prices of many goods, ranging from silver to soybeans to coffee, fueled the rise.As a consequence, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 23.94 to 3742.41, and bond prices declined, sending yields on long-term Treasuries up to 7.43 from 7.30 Friday.''You still have an economy that is growing fairly rapidly, and so you do come out with the view that we are likely to see some acceleration of inflation in the second half of the year,"" See MARKETS, D2, Col. 1"

1,"WASHINGTON -- The economy grew at a strong 4.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said, rather than the 3.9% rate estimated by the agency last month.The large revision in the inflation-adjusted gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services, was due principally to an unexpected reduction in December's trade deficit from the earlier estimate. For its earlier GNP report, the department had estimated that the December trade deficit would approach $10 billion, but in fact the deficit, as reported three weeks ago, was $8.2 billion. The deficit is a negative factor in calculating the GNP.Most analysts believe the easing in the trade deficit is temporary, resulting from the economy's slowdown in the third quarter. They expect the rapid growth of the economy in the fourth quarter, combined with the continued strength of the dollar, to cause the deficit to get even larger next year.The economy grew at a sluggish 1.6% rate in the third quarter. GNP in the fourth quarter of 1984 was 5.9% over the fourth quarter of 1983, rather than 5.6% as reported last month. And the full-year's output was 6.9% higher than in 1983, rather than 6.8% as previously reported.The strong growth in the fourth quarter makes it clear that the economy began 1985 with considerable momentum."

0,"Author: Edward P. LazearAs Washington debates the fate of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, many lawmakers have fallen into a logical trap of their own making. Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an ""inflation-minus-one"" rule to constrain future spending increases.Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years. As the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in the journal American Economic Review, such high debt-to-GDP ratios are associated with low growth."
1,"WASHINGTON -- Economic forecasters surveyed quarterly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia no longer expect as much of a slowdown in the U.S. economy during the first half of the year.The average of the 33 private forecasts put growth in the first two quarters of 1999 at an annual 2.85% pace, well above the 1.7% they predicted just three months ago. The economy expanded at a 3.9% rate in 1998.Despite the economy's stronger-than-expected growth, the forecasters are more optimistic about inflation than they were in previous surveys. They expect consumer prices to rise only 2% in 1999, marking down their forecasts to reflect changes in the government's consumer price index. Over the next decade, the forecasters expect the CPI to climb 2.3% a year.With continued growth and little uptick in inflation, the forecasters expect the stock market to keep climbing over the next decade, but they foresee returns closer to the historical norm. On average, they expect the total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 index to be 8% a year after inflation, down from the 9% they forecast last year. The inflation-adjusted return on the S&P 500 last year exceeded 20%. The Philadelphia Fed doesn't probe for the forecasters' short-term outlook for the stock market.Over the next decade, the forecasters are predicting that the U.S. economy will expand at about 2.5% a year, after adjusting for inflation, and that productivity, or output per hour of work, will climb 1.55%, up slightly from 1.5% in last quarter's survey."
1,"During the debt-ceiling debate, President Obama characterized his push for higher taxes and less aggressive budget cuts as being helpful to the middle class. The claim was that failing to raise taxes on high-income earners would place a disproportionate share of the pain on the rest. But it is our record-high government spending, not the failure to raise taxes on the rich, that is the typical American's largest long-term problem.Workers do well only when the economy grows at a healthy and consistent pace. The biggest threat to long-term economic growth is government growth of the magnitude that characterized the past two years and that is forecast for our future.Our current problems are not a result of acts of nature. They stem from policy choices that dramatically increased the size of the government. In the past two years, the federal budget has grown by a whopping 16%. Importantly, growth in agency budgets other than Defense exceeded that in Defense, despite the surge in Afghanistan. The budget for Health and Human Services, for example, home to Medicare and Medicaid, rose a hefty 22%, as compared with 12% for Defense.The sum of 11 other agencies, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Labor, which combined account for more annual spending than Defense, experienced an increase of more than 50% over the two-year period. Some of the budget increases, like those associated with unemployment insurance, should disappear when the economy rebounds, but much of the addition is permanent and is reflected in the president's projected future budget numbers.What has the increase bought us? The president would have us believe that but for the stimulus, the economy would have sunk into the next Great Depression. The numbers tell a different story. Estimates of the effect of the stimulus on gross domestic product (GDP) range from zero to three percentage points of GDP. The current recession set GDP back by nine percentage points relative to where it would have been had times been normal."

1,"Let's keep this tax thing in perspective. Suppose Congress and the White House decide to raise taxes $25 billion. That's less than a 2.5 percent increase in overall federal taxes. Suppose that ultimately another $25 billion is needed to close the budget deficits. The total still represents less than a 5 percent increase. No one likes to pay higher taxes, but these amounts won't impoverish most Americans or cripple the economy.How will we get hit? Higher ""sin"" taxes on cigarettes, beer and liquor seem likely. So are steeper ""user fees"" for, say, airline passengers. The impulse of Democrats and Republicans alike is to construct a package of many small-and highly technical-increases so that no one sees much impact. The budget summit should do better than that.It should not just raise taxes but should do so in a way that makes the overall federal tax system fairer and more efficient. How about a ""carbon tax"": a tax on oil, natural gas and coal? This would depress energy use, air pollution and emissions that contribute to the ""greenhouse effect."" How about taxing capital gains (the profits on the sales of stock or other assets) when people die? Closing this loophole, which benefits mainly the wealthy, could raise at least $2 billion to $3 billion a year.As they go about this political drudgery, the White House and Congress should adhere to three guidelines:First, keep income-tax rates low. A tax system with high rates and many special tax breaks (credits, deductions, income exclusions) invites abuse and waste. Hordes of tax lawyers and accountants are deployed to help people and companies minimize their taxes. Investment decisions are skewed by tax breaks. The 1986 tax-reform act was an attempt to get away from this sort of system by lowering tax rates and eliminating some tax breaks. We shouldn't backtrack on it."

Some of the nervousness in Europe relates to fears about the health of the U.S. economy, but significant concern remains that policy makers' recent efforts to bolster Greece and implement measures to backstop the rest of the euro zone aren't convincing."

Looking ahead, 61% said their cities will be less able to meet financial needs in 2005 than in 2004. (Fiscal years start in January, July, or October depending on the city.) The survey is expected to be released today.The financial officers blamed rising costs for employee health benefits, wages, public safety, increased infrastructure needs and employee pensions.

Fred Bergisten, assistant Treasury secretary for international economics in the Carter administration.Both men who are associated in the Institute for International Economics where Bergsten is the director and Peterson chairman of the board predicted that the merchandise trade deficit could reach $100 billion by next year, far higher than Reagan administration projections. Martin Feldstein, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said in mid-November that the 1983 trade deficit would be between $60 billion and $70 billion.Peterson, board chairman of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., added that the burgeoning trade gap could account for between 1 billion and 2 billion lost job opportunities and suggested that the administration and Congress should concentrate on trade problems rather than a road and bridge rebuilding program, which would add only 300,000 jobs."

A separate measure, which includes members of the military among the employed, dropped to 7.4% in May from 7.7%.The drop returned the jobless rate to its level of November 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president. Any further declines in the coming months will enable the president to claim during his reelection campaign that his administration brought down both inflation and unemployment.But the decline of the unemployment rate is more a reflection of the economy's previous strength than of its strength in May. While employment rose sharply during the month, the number of hours worked by the average employee declined from the unusually high level of April, and average earnings also declined. That suggests industrial production and personal income rose modestly in May, if at all.""We just exchanged bodies for hours,"" said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University.

Auto sales rebounded to their highest level since April. Chain-store sales posted year-on-year growth of 5.5%. The economy added 103,000 jobs, and manufacturing sentiment improved a bit. On Friday, Commerce Department figures are expected to show a strong 0.8% monthly increase in retail and food-service sales, while consumer sentiment may show some brightening of attitudes as well.What? If this feels like a 180-degree turn from August, it basically is. It would be one thing if this were a special case, or a broad turning point. But these jerky swings have become the norm. Consider what has happened so far this year: Real gross domestic product shrank in January and February, according to tracking firm Macroeconomic Advisers. Then it surged more than 1% in March. It contracted again in May and June -- only to jump more than 1% again in July.This isn't typical. Since 1992, monthly GDP has fallen about a third of the time when the economy hasn't been in recession. This year, even assuming a small gain in August, monthly GDP has fallen about half the time. It is even less common to see GDP growth above 1% in any given month; that usually happens only about once a year. In the first half of 2011 alone, it happened twice.No surprise, then, that stocks have been swinging wildly. After sinking to just shy of bear-market territory, the S&P 500 jumped nearly 8% in the eight trading sessions through Thursday.

1,"The Treasury Department is not worried that the weakening dollar, which makes U.S. assets less attractive, will affect the level of foreign demand for government securities, a Treasury official said yesterday.The official, Charles O. Sethness, assistant secretary for domestic finance, also said Treasury plans to sell $29 billion in new securities in its quarterly refunding next week to raise $14.3 billion in new cash and refund $14.7 billion of publicly held coupon securities maturing on Feb. 15.Some financial market analysts had expressed concern during the past few weeks that the sharp dip in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen would make U.S. Treasury securities less attractive to Japanese investors, requiring the Treasury to bid up interest rates on those issues to lure foreigners back.A weaker dollar means that foreigners earn less on their investments when their profits are converted into their own currencies. The government needs foreign participation in its securities to finance the deficit.The government said in a special budget supplement issued yesterday that the proportion of federal debt held by foreigners has actually declined compared to the late 1970s and early 1980s. For example, foreigners held 19 percent of U.S. debt in 1979, compared with 15 percent last year. The government attributed this trend to the rapid growth in total government securities outstanding."

1,"WASHINGTON -- Business inventories and sales both rose at the same rate in November, suggesting that U.S. merchants and manufacturers were successfully balancing the stocks on their shelves against growing consumer demand.Manufacturers, retailers and merchant wholesalers expanded their inventories to $753.56 billion of goods in November, up 0.4% from $750.59 billion in October, the Commerce Department reported. At the same time sales grew to $503.84 billion from $501.91 billion, also a 0.4% increase. The numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations but not for inflation.""The inventory area is traditionally where if there are mistakes, we tend to see them,"" said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities in Chicago. ""But the truth is that doesn't seem to be occurring. Businesses are keeping inventories in line with overall activities.""Fat inventory levels can send mixed economic signals. Rising levels of stocks are healthy if consumers are buying the items. But if businesses overestimate demand, they can be stuck holding goods they can't sell.This doesn't seem to have been a problem in recent months. Overall, inventories equaled 1.50 months' sales in November, the same ratio as October and just below September's level of 1.51, the Commerce Department said."

Housing ""is set to exert a longer and more potent than expected drag"" on the U.S. economy, said Jean-Philippe Cotis, chief economist for the Paris-based economic think tank. Consumers will also be tested by ""mortgage rate resets, tighter credit standards, weaker collaterals and slower job creation."" In a press briefing, Mr. Costis also said he expects the Federal Reserve to ease rates sooner rather than later. Another ominous, yet inconclusive, indicator of the direction of the U.S. economy out early Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report, said that jobs in the private sector rose by 38,000 in August, much less than expectations. This data tidbit shined one of the first statistical spotlights on the economy in August, when the worries over exposure to subprime securities spooked investors out of credit markets. Still, Goldman Sachs economists warned that the ADP report ""gives a picture of the labor market for the week of Aug. 12, only part way through the market turmoil and before employment could really react to the ongoing credit crunch. More weakness could well be yet to come.""Also out Wednesday were housing numbers from the National Association of Realtors. The group's index of pending sales of existing homes decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.2% in July from June, the industry group said Wednesday. The NAR index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 16.1% below the level of July 2006. An NAR statement accompanying the data release also suggested existing-home sales will likely sag more as mortgage disruptions tied to credit concerns work their way into the housing market. BNP Paribas economists noted that ""most worryingly is that this report is clearly 'pre-turmoil', reflecting resale transactions agreed in July, so before August's financial market turmoil, lurch higher in jumbo mortgage rates and the freezing over of much of the mortgage market. How bad next month's pending sales index (and this month's new home sales report) might be is really quite frightening."" Still more economic reports are on tap for later today, when the Federal Reserve will release its ""beige book"" report. Concerns over the credit crunch and statements from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week will put extra weight on the regularly published collection of on-the-ground business anecdotes from the Fed's 12 regional banks.Housing figures proved particularly difficult for investors to digest, and major indexes reversed course after Tuesday's rally.

Observers say the sector's gains weren't so much the result of increased buying of microcap stocks, but rather a lack of selling as the rest of the stock market headed lower.According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., microcap funds provided investors with a 5.54% return in August. And while that was the smallest monthly gain for the group since April, it topped all other categories of equity funds during August. The closest sector was small-cap funds, which posted a 1.83% gain for the month.Funds that had been the big winners all year -- funds tied to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- were the big losers among domestic stock funds in August, dropping 5.59%.Over the past 13 weeks, microcap stocks are well ahead of all other domestic equity funds, with a nearly 19% gain since June 6.

0,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's latest survey of regional economic conditions found ""modest growth,"" but at a slower pace than in recent months because of weak consumer spending.For retailers, it's beginning to look a lot like a sluggish Christmas, the Fed concluded in a summary of reports collected by the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks in September and October. Sales of fall and back-to-school goods were almost uniformly ""disappointing or below expectations,"" the Fed said.Manufacturing picked up in some districts, however. The Philadelphia Fed, for example, found strong demand for electrical machinery, metals and glass products. ""It's not a boom, mind you,"" a steel production representative cautioned the Chicago Fed. Indeed, purchase orders mostly softened in the Dallas and Cleveland districts.In keeping with what analysts call a slow but steadily growing economy, construction improved slightly, and there was a ""firming"" in commercial and industrial leasing activity. Also, inflation remains under control. Wage gains were moderate, despite mostly tight labor markets, and reports of rapidly rising materials costs fell off substantially, the report said.But the reluctance of consumers to spend is keeping the slow-rolling economy from shedding its training wheels. In the Boston district, where sales in September and October fell by as much as 20% from the year-earlier period, widespread discounting is ""eating away at gross margins and profits,"" the Boston Fed said. Without any intriguing new fashion offerings, apparel sales continue to fare the worst. But the New York Fed said sales of big-ticket items such as furniture and home electronics also softened."

Unofficially, through the first six months of 1986, $80.5 billion of new corporates have been marketed.With the new issue calendar averaging $3.8 billion of corporates each week, the marketplace literally has been deluged.In order to market these new bonds, a new issue is priced at a yield spread off of a Treasury issue with a similar maturity. For example, in early January, a 30-year AA public utility bond was priced to offer 120 basis points more yield than the 30-year Treasury.As the new issue primary market continued to grow, the secondary market languished. What developed was a two-tier corporate bond market as buyers of the new issues sold their old bonds into the secondary market to pay for the new bonds. Consequently, the dealers have been unable to move the older bonds and they are loaded with inventory while the yields on these seasoned bonds have continued to rise.

0,"Author: Allan H. MeltzerWould the late Milton Friedman have endorsed the Federal Reserve's plan to make large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury bonds? The idea here is to pump more money into and thus jump-start the economy, reducing unemployment. Some people, including this newspaper's David Wessel in a column last week, believe the great Nobel laureate would favor this inflationary program. I am certain he would not.Friedman's main message for central banks was to maintain a monetary rule that kept the growth of the money supply constant. In his Newsweek column, ""Inflation and Jobs"" (Nov. 12, 1979), for example, Friedman emphasized that ""unemployment is . . . a side effect of the cure for inflation,"" so that if a central bank ""cured"" unemployment by inflating, it ""will have unemployment later."" In other words, don't try it.Friedman's Newsweek column for July 28, 1980 (""Improving Monetary Policy"") came with the unemployment rate rising past 7%. His proposals for improving policy made no mention of using monetary expansion to reduce unemployment. He proposed rules for stable growth to achieve target ""dollar levels of monetary aggregates.""Friedman served on President Reagan's economic policy advisory board. His memos on monetary policy repeat the themes he made familiar to Newsweek readers and others all over the world. There is not a word suggesting that monetary policy should try to raise the inflation rate in order to reduce the unemployment rate."

Recession seems to be looming or, if not, inflation is threatening, or the markets are down, or productivity is lagging, or something else is wrong that the voters might hold them responsible for. By the middle of their term, the economist Herbert Stein has observed. Presidents come face to face with the dreadful prospect that unless they change course, they might enter their re-election campaign with an economy in misery. This is a condition that frequently afflicts administrations in their second or third year and sets them to searching, open-mindedly or desperately, for new solutions, Mr. Stein, who headed Richard M. Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in his book, Presidential Economics. to abandon his stance against tax increases. But if so, it may have been a passing impulse.

In calling for government to end corporate pork-barrel politics, we were taking a moral stand.The first Americans hated taxes; the Constitution limited government and, originally, banned levies on personal income. For the first two centuries of our nation, the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. Per capita U.S. gross domestic product grew to $28,540 in 1996 from just $919 (in 1996 dollars) in 1776. Mankind took 30,000 years to get to $919, but only 220 more years to reach $28,540. But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending. Eliminating corporate welfare is a moral imperative: We should not be asking senior citizens and the poor to tighten their belts while our government is, actually subsidizes the sale of American chardonnay to the French.Taxing and spending to support U.S. industry creates a vicious circle. With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to ""bring home the pork"" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as ""government investments"" or ""government-industry partnerships."" Such Washington-speak notwithstanding, Americans are compelled to pay for silly programs like the proposal by the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program to genetically re-engineer cotton, making its fibers more like polyester.

Similarly, sales in Rocky Mountain states were boosted by workers' confidence in some of their dominant industries, such as New Mexico's defense contractors.

Mr. Bentsen indicated some congressional Democrats fear such a move could interfere with Mr. Clinton's goal of creating 500,000 jobs this year.Mr. Bentsen said the discussions with lawmakers, however, don't anticipate any delay in the increase in the corporate income tax, which would also be retroactive to Jan. 1. Jobs Are Paramount ""What we want to be sure of is that we achieve the 500,000 jobs,"" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview yesterday. Although expressing a willingness to consider the congressional concerns, Mr. Bentsen said he believes the recent decline in long-term interest rates would more than compensate for any slowing of the economy that might be caused by the higher tax rates.Lower interest rates encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and Mr. Bentsen said the decline in interest rates in response to the Clinton plan has been ""more than I anticipated."" On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7%, its lowest mark since the government began issuing the bonds regularly in 1977.Delaying the effective dates of the new 36% and 39.6% marginal income tax rates for a year would reduce by about $10 billion the revenue Mr. Clinton's plan would produce. But Mr. Bentsen said the administration would move up the effective dates of other tax increases to compensate so that it could still reach its 1997 deficit-reduction goal. The new energy tax, for instance, could be phased in more rapidly; currently, it is to be phased in over three years beginning July 1, 1994."

1,"The bears went on the offensive in the Treasury market Friday after a data deluge further eroded fading hopes for a Fed rate cut this year.With a 5% yield on the benchmark 10-year note a hair's breadth away, some investors already are bracing for more of a bear run.Within 90 minutes, Treasury traders were hit by some of the most significant numbers on the U.S. economic calendar. First, there were data on nonfarm payrolls and personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's favored inflation gauge. Rounding things off were the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey, the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey and pending home sales.If this economic Super Friday had revealed across-the-board economic weakness, it could easily have blunted -- and may have reversed -- a Treasury-market bear run that saw prices slide through most of May.It wasn't so. What proved to be mixed economic data kept the selling pressure intact and lifted the yield on the 10-year note to 4.955%. And with market momentum as strong as it is and traders talking of accelerating mortgage-related selling, the risk of falling deep in the red looks significant."

0,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy's current weakness may not respond to the Federal Reserve's conventional medicine of rapidly cutting the short-term interest rates it controls, Fed Gov. Wayne Angell said.Mr. Angell's prescription for Fed policy: ""Ease at a slower pace than the market anticipates. That way we get long-term rates to fall. Since April of 1989, that's been my game plan.""Because so many of the economy's ills reflect a real estate bust, the Fed instead needs to bring down long-term interest rates, Mr. Angell said in an interview. Those rates are set largely in financial markets -- and reflect expectations of inflation as well as the credibility of the Fed's anti-inflation commitment.Mr. Angell insisted that he wasn't revealing how he voted at the last meeting of Fed policy makers or how he intended to vote when they meet in two weeks, but his analysis suggests a go-slow approach.The Fed is under pressure to cut short-term rates further in response to what is now widely regarded as a recession. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is believed to have been given leeway to reduce rates before the Fed's policy committee convenes again in about two weeks. But internal objections could dissuade him from doing so."

""Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence of the ability to reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants."" A copy of the text was released in Washington.California's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent a ""worrisome situation for Californians, certainly,"" Greenspan said. ""And because the state comprises one-eighth of our national [economy], it should be a concern for the U.S. economic outlook as well. Fortunately, the overall effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states, seems to have been modest, at least to date.""Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for new plants and equipment.""As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices"" of the things they sell, he said."

As a result, banks are expected to try to unload some of those loans this week at fire-sale prices.Nervous buyers also have retreated in recent days from the market for securities backed by student loans and municipal bonds, roiling some corners of the short-term money markets.

0,"NEW YORK -- Stocks, bonds and the dollar all stumbled coming out of the gate on the first day of trading in 1989.The dollar tripped first in what traders said was a reaction to the artificially strong demand for the currency in the closing days of 1988. The weaker dollar, coupled with a report that indicated the economy remains strong in the face of rising short-term interest rates, sent bond prices sprawling. And after that the fall in stock prices was almost anti-climactic.The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 23.93 to 2144.64 after being off nearly 40 points early in the afternoon. Computer-generated trading fueled much of the decline.But analysts cautioned that yesterday's price action doesn't necessarily mean the financial markets have nowhere to go but down in 1989. ""I think there's less here than meets the eye,"" said Peter Canelo, a portfolio strategist at Bear Stearns. ""I don't think there's a clear direction on the economy, and there isn't any conviction about interest rates.""As 1988 drew to an end, investors were looking for signs that the economy is slowing in reaction to the Federal Reserve's steady effort to drive interest rates higher. Instead, the early evidence points to a stronger than expected economy in December that will require even more interest rate discipline. That hurts bond prices in the short run and increases the chances that when the economy does slow it could do so abruptly, perhaps falling into recession. A sharp slowdown would undermine corporate profits, the main prop for stock prices."

Thus analysts say DEC profit will drop as much as 60% in its fiscal second quarter ending Monday.A big part of the problem for DEC and other companies such as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp., which analysts expect to post a fourth-quarter net loss, is the rapidly growing trend toward open systems -- computers that use standard software such as programs written for Unix operating systems. That hurts makers of proprietary systems -- those that run software written only for them.But it's a boon for Sun and large PC makers such as Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., which, despite recession signs, continue to post strong gains.

1,"WASHINGTON -- The number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a three-month low last week, validating the Federal Reserve's judgment that the long-depressed labor market is stabilizing.Initial jobless claims declined 22,000 to 404,000 last week from 426,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. The four-week average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, fell to a one-month low of 428,250.The drop was more than Wall Street economists expected, but it supported the Fed's statement Wednesday that ""labor and product markets . . . are stabilizing."" The central bank on Wednesday cut its key interest rate to a 45-year low of 1% from 1.25% and suggested it will keep the rate low as long as necessary to ensure an economic recovery. The Fed's assertion that the labor market was stabilizing surprised some observers, but it may have been influenced by the latest jobless claims data.During the past 2 1/2 years, the U.S. economy has lost more than three million private-sector jobs, and the unemployment rate has climbed to a nine-year high of 6.1%. The number of initial claims for unemployment benefits, moreover, has remained above 400,000 for 19 consecutive weeks. Economists regard any number above 400,000 as suggestive of a deteriorating jobs market.But for the past three weeks, the volume of initial claims has declined consistently, and economic forecasters say they expect job losses to end soon. The total number of workers drawing unemployment benefits for more than a week rose 43,000 to 3,741,000, reversing half of the previous week's decline. The unemployment rate for workers with unemployment insurance climbed 0.1 percentage point to 3%."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 32.95% since the beginning of 1995, and the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index has risen 33.25%.But the march of the averages has masked more than a few difficulties. To be blunt, several sectors of the U.S. stock market have been real dogs. Chain stores have stumbled like Marley's ghost through the entire year, with Caldor, Bradlees and Kmart all losing ground. In December alone, big companies such as Reebok, Advanced Micro Devices, Office Depot, Best Buy and Georgia-Pacific hit 52-week lows.Moreover, money managers with diversified portfolios find themselves struggling to keep pace with the blistering pace set by the major market indexes, and small stocks have been market laggards.That mixed performance raises several questions about just how strong the 1995 bull market advance has really been and leaves some analysts unimpressed.""The advance this year has been somewhat narrow,"" says Richard McCabe, technical analyst at Merrill Lynch. ""Even though breadth hasn't been horrible, it really hasn't been that spectacular. Therefore, you have a handful of blue chips leading the way.

1,"WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees.And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the ""strength in the U.S. economy"" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade."

1,"Friday's bullish report of 211,000 new jobs in March and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% -- matching its lowest level in five years -- brings further evidence that the great American jobs machine rolls on. Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France."

Shipments rose 1.3% in June and unfilled orders increased 0.1%. Orders for May, meanwhile, were revised upward to unchanged from a previously estimated decline of 0.4%.While the improvement in orders is hardly enough to signal that manufacturing is out of the woods, it may suggest that the long- suffering industry could be poised for better times ahead.

0,"Author: Alan GreenspanAn urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining some traction among American lawmakers. If so, it is none too soon. Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are misleading.Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months--to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion--inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.The roots of the apparent debt market calm are clear enough. The financial crisis, triggered by the unexpected default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, created a collapse in global demand that engendered a high degree of deflationary slack in our economy. The very large contraction of private financing demand freed private saving to finance the explosion of federal debt. Although our financial institutions have recovered perceptibly and returned to a degree of solvency, banks, pending a significant increase in capital, remain reluctant to lend.Beneath the calm, there are market signals that do not bode well for the future. For generations there had been a large buffer between the borrowing capacity of the U.S. government and the level of its debt to the public. But in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, that gap began to narrow rapidly. Federal debt to the public rose to 59% of GDP by mid-June 2010 from 38% in September 2008. How much borrowing leeway at current interest rates remains for U.S. Treasury financing is highly uncertain."

1,"Alan Murray's Dec. 3 column ""Political Calculus: Bush Now Embraces a Stimulus Package"" suggests that the administration's economic-stimulus plan is largely politically motivated and would have only a moderate short-term economic impact. Isn't it a little early to start criticizing a plan that is still being developed?Though we are encouraged by some recent signs of a rebound, the economy is recovering at half the rate of past recessions. A carefully crafted consumer, investor and business tax package would provide the synergies needed to push the economy into high gear and help ensure durable economic growth. In a recent letter to the president, we suggested cutting consumer taxes, allowing larger depreciation write-offs and reducing the double taxation of dividends.Our studies show that allowing companies to deduct 50% of corporate dividends would add one-half a percentage point to average GDP growth through 2005. Similarly, our study shows that this change would accelerate productivity growth to 2.4% over the next three years, compared with 2% without this change. A phased reduction of the double tax on corporate dividends would encourage firms to rely more on equity financing, leading to higher investment spending and a larger capital stock.One of the most effective ways to spur business investment and continued technological advances that promote productivity growth is through an enhanced capital-cost recovery system. Finally, accelerating the tax cuts enacted in June 2001 will help ensure that consumer confidence and spending remain strong. Because many small businesses pay taxes at the individual rate, they also will benefit from accelerated rate cuts.Jerry Jasinowski"

The attacks led to Afghanistan and Iraq, wars that already have cost nearly twice what Vietnam did, adjusted for inflation.Putting a price tag on the human toll from 9/11 is impossible. Nearly 3,000 were killed in the attacks. More than 6,200 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Measuring the impact of 9/11 on the American psyche and its sense of security and freedom is difficult.But one can, with the hindsight of a decade, begin to tally the quantifiable economic costs."

The rate eased to 7 percent in 1993 and the growth rate now has fallen again to 6.4 percent. Despite the small 1994 rise, U.S. health spending still makes up a higher proportion of gross domestic product than any other developed nation's, 13.7 percent in 1994.Authors Katharine Levit, Helen Lazenby and Lekha Sivarajan said the slow rate of increase appears to stem from employers switching coverage for their workers from conventional fee-for-service plans to health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans that often charge less. Low inflation also is a contributing factor.The new figures appear to support the arguments of health analysts like Gail Wilensky, who chairs the Congressional Physician Payment Review Commission, and GOP members of Congress, like Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.), who believe that increasing competition in the health industry is squeezing waste and holding down cost growth."

Passage of the budget agreement by the Senate and House is uncertain, and bond investors may not take as sanguine a view of the proposed spending cuts and tax increases as the Fed chief has.The budget accord aims to take $40.1 billion off the federal budget deficit in fiscal 1991, and $500 billion over five years, through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.5425 marks, down from 1.5495 marks late Tuesday in New York. The dollar bottomed out at 1.5403 marks, nearing its record low of 1.5385 marks, set Aug. 27."

0,"WASHINGTON--Major Wall Street banks said they will sell business lines, let the government take over certain subsidiaries and enter into bankruptcy proceedings to avoid a taxpayer-funded bailout in the event of another financial crisis.The latest round of so-called living wills, released by regulators Thursday, showcased the disparate approaches banks plan to take to dismantle their firms in times of severe market stress.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said its ""preferred strategy"" would be to avoid insolvency by recapitalizing its major U.S. and U.K. broker-dealers, as well as other key businesses. Citigroup Inc. would try to sell off its broker-dealer units first before letting the parent company fail under one scenario. Bank of America Corp. said the ""simplest approach"" to winding down its business would be through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by its holding company, with its subsidiaries continuing to operate. If unable to recapitalize its business, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. would sell or divest business lines or conduct a ""rapid and orderly wind down in proceedings"" through bankruptcy.The plans, only a small portion of which are released publicly by the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., highlight the challenges banks and regulators face as they try to ensure that increasingly complex financial firms could be dismantled without government aid.Ernie Patrikis, a banking partner at law firm White & Case, expressed doubts about how useful the plans would be in times of crisis.

The U.S. currency on Friday traded below parity with the Swiss franc for the first time. It likewise is in full retreat versus the yen, falling below 100 yen to its lowest levels in nearly 13 years.This is the dark corner from which the dollar confronts the likelihood of another considerable Federal Reserve rate cut tomorrow that would only put it at a greater disadvantage against currencies from countries where rates are higher.That prospect has many wondering whether tomorrow's expected rate cut might not tip the dollar's deterioration into a disorderly rout, in turn requiring coordinated central-bank intervention to restore some two-way risk to the market."

But they still face an imminent threat to their portfolios: a slowing economy at home and increased interest rates abroad.In such an environment, the dollar often suffers. When that happens, strategists and money managers tend to counsel clients to favor shares of large companies. The idea is that because these companies tend to be multinationals that earn large chunks of revenue from operations outside the U.S., they are better positioned to weather weakness at home. Also, increased overseas interest rates support foreign currencies, making earnings abroad worth more when the income is ""repatriated"" into weaker dollars.Trouble is, the recent track record for that advice isn't what it used to be.""In the last 14 years, there's really been no advantage to moving to large-cap stocks"" during times of dollar weakness, said Mike Thompson, research director at Thomson Financial, referring to companies with the biggest stock-market values.The research firm compared the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, made up mostly of big multinationals, with various European currencies.

1,"The presumed American birthright of rising living standards has been on hold for 15 years. Average hourly pay of blue-collar and clerical workers is slightly lower in purchasing power now than it was in 1973 and has made no progress even in the prosperous mid-1980s. Counting managers, professionals, other self-employed people, and the rising share of employee compensation received as fringe benefits, real earnings per hour have increased only 0.7% a year from 1973 through 1987.Income per capita has risen faster than income per hour because a larger share of the adult population is working more hours per capita. In other words, we are working harder for it, and this has its cost in leisure, child care, and home-cooked meals. Per-capita income also rose faster than hourly pay because of the faster rise in interest income and Social Security.The reasons for stagnant real wages will be much debated in this election year. But this epoch may now be ending, regardless of who becomes the next president.The world's postwar economic boom foundered in the 1970s just when the U.S. labor force was growing at a pace unmatched since early in the century. Pay fell behind oil-fueled price rises partly because plentiful young workers were a drag on productivity. Young and other marginal workers, including swelling ranks of low-income single mothers, lost ground rapidly relative to others in the general retrenchment in the 1980s.Intense foreign competition, due mainly to exchange-rate maladjustments, held down wages (as well as prices and profits) in the mid-1980s in all industries exposed to international competition. Some of the lag in average wages stemmed from erosion of union wage scales that were out of line with the rest of the economy. Union wages in manufacturing, construction and transportation have been undermined by spreading nonunion competition. Federal deregulation of the airline and trucking industries accelerated the breakdown of their sheltered wage and price structures by allowing new competition in markets that for decades had been protected."

The Wirthlin polls also suggest that Reagan has defused the nuclear freeze issue by his arms control initiatives and has generally improved his standing on foreign policy, even as it is slumping on economic performance.But the public perception of the Reagan foreign policy, like the policy itself, is clouded by events in the Middle East. Two of three Americans think the U.S. response to the Israelis after the invasion of Lebanon was too weak even though the Palestine Liberation Organization has the lowest standing of any institution or individualOverall, the dualism of Reagan's standing with the electorate can be expressed in a single sentence: Three of 10 Americans who disagree with Reagan policies remain supportive of the president.

The results follow the strong showing of bellwether Intel Corp., which Tuesday announced quarterly profit that nearly quadrupled on a 44% jump in sales.The trio of results kicks off what is likely to be a strong earnings streak as tech spending by companies and consumers picks up. Next week, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., among others, are slated to report quarterly results.

""That gave a better tone to the tape and that's what gave legs to the market,"" Mr. Peluso said.Financial stocks benefited from news that second-quarter economic growth was slower than initially believed and that unemployment claims were up last week.

Those rates are adjusted for inflation, which ran at a 2.9 percent pace for the quarter.But many forecasters now think growth this quarter will turn out to be at a 1 percent rate or even less. They also believe the first half of 1990 will be sluggish. The Bush administration has predicted 2.6 percent growth for 1990, higher than most private analysts."

As in previous months, much of that increase stems from a sharp run-up in the cost of energy goods, which soared 7.5%, the biggest gain in almost a decade. Wholesale prices overall were 4% higher than they were in February 1999, the largest year-over-year change in more than 13 months.On the other hand, the report offers some reason for optimism. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3% for the month, with a 6.3% surge in cigarette prices accounting for all of that increase. For the past 12 months, prices for core finished goods climbed just 1%, the lowest year-over-year change since last November.Investors seemed undisturbed by yesterday's inflation report.

The numbers suggest that the jobless rate will increase in coming months.Still, the unemployment picture has yet to take a bite out of consumer's confidence in the economy.

0,"WASHINGTON -- Thanks mostly to better-than-anticipated economic conditions, the fiscal 1995 federal budget deficit is projected to be $13 billion less than earlier projections, the Congressional Budget Office said.The CBO's new $161 billion deficit projection is roughly in line with the $160 billion projection the Clinton administration released last month for the fiscal year ending Sept 30. If it meets expectations, the deficit would be the smallest since 1989. As a percentage of the nation's total economic output, or gross domestic product, the deficit, at 2.3%, would be the smallest since 1979, the CBO said.The revised figures were reported as part of the CBO's midyear economic and budget update.In keeping with previous predictions, the CBO said the deficit would begin to increase again starting next year, rising to $189 billion in fiscal 1996. The 1996 deficit projection is $21 billion lower than earlier projections. Without efforts to reduce federal spending, as have been proposed by congressional Republicans, the deficit would reach $350 billion by 2002, the CBO said.The 1995 and 1996 deficits are expected to come in lower than anticipated largely due to factors such as declining interest rates, which the CBO said are expected to be about a full percentage point lower than previously forecast. On the other hand, the CBO said, ""legislation adopted so far this year has scarcely affected budget totals."""

The discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions -- is largely symbolic. But in conjunction with the move, the Fed also quietly lowered its target for the important federal funds interest rate to 5.75% from 6%. Other interest rates are expected to fall in turn.The Fed's move followed several days of international meetings at which the Bush administration argued vehemently but unsuccessfully for global interest-rate cuts. President Bush was quick to praise the Fed's action, saying it was ""very good news"" and showed ""a very strong leadership role by the Fed.""The Fed's action comes as the Bush administration has begun considering whether to reappoint Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman when his term expires in August. Some administration officials -- including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu -- have been critical of Mr. Greenspan because of the Fed's reluctance to cut rates. But administration officials said Mr. Bush's praise yesterday is a sign that he is likely to reappoint Mr. Greenspan.Officials familiar with the Fed's deliberations say the board has been debating the rate-cutting move for several weeks.

The move was the third tightening by the central bank this year.Moreover, the committee members leaned toward a further firming. The panel decided that before its next meeting, ""some added reserve restraint would be acceptable, or some slight lessening of reserve pressure might be acceptable, depending on ongoing economic and financial developments."" Since the meeting, the Fed has indicated it has made no significant changes in policy, but it has appeared to be willing to err slightly on the side of a tighter policy.The minutes were released after the customary delay of six to eight weeks. The committee held another meeting last week. Minutes of that meeting won't be released until next month.The panel's May move toward tighter credit reflected a perceived need ""to counter the risks of rising inflationary pressures in the economy,"" the minutes said, and a view that a failure to act would mean more stringent steps would be needed later. The members said the economy remained strong, with unemployment relatively low and factories using a rising percentage of available capacity."

Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999.But as the trade imbalance continued to swell, there was a tiny ray of sunshine in the November numbers: U.S. export performance, dismal for much of 1999, was slightly improved, rising $557 million to $82.89 billion on increased demand for telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and other products.Imports, as usual, outperformed exports, swelling to $109.39 billion from October's $107.90 billion. It was the U.S.'s worst trade performance since the Commerce Department started compiling the monthly numbers in 1992.While steadily climbing trade deficits are worrisome politically, they leave many economists sanguine.

So as the decade's last economic summit unfolds in Paris after yet another year of growth, it's as good a time as any to examine how wrong the fear and loathing has been.My favorite doomsayer is Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics, a frequently quoted outfit that has served as an inverse indicator during the 1980s; whatever it says will happen almost certainly won't. Last May, Mr. Marris told the Business Council that, ""If the next president of the United States . . . does not act immediately and decisively to cut the budget deficit, he is going to preside over the decline and fall of this great nation.""Mr. Marris was building on his earlier insight, offered in 1984, that ""time is running out.""

Alas the recovery, like the nation, keeps rolling along.It's unfair to single out Mr. Marris, so let's widen the memory net. Fred Bergsten, his partner in prophecy at IIE, wrote last November that, ""there is still time to avert disaster,"" if only then President-elect Bush would raise taxes and devalue the dollar.

0,"NEW YORK -- Small investors, worried about a recession but afraid of missing out on the stock market's gains, are turning to a conservative old standby: high-yielding stock mutual funds.These ""may not be high-flyers, but they get you back into the equity market without a lot of risk,"" says Lawrence Kantor, executive vice president at Lexington Management Co. in Saddle Brook, N.J.Minimizing risk has a high priority for individual investors since the October 1987 market crash, which left many with a distaste for stocks. Millions poured cash into safer money-market funds, where yields sometimes exceed 10%, or Treasury bills, which now yield 8 1/2% or more.But recently money managers have noticed an increasing appetite among small investors for stock funds managed with a conservative strategy, especially those that invest in old-line, blue-chip companies that pay hefty dividends. The appeal of such funds suggests that small investors want to play the stock market -- but want a cushion in case a recession develops.T. Rowe Price Associates' Equity Income Fund, the firm's most conservative stock fund, expanded its assets 70% this year to $850 million from $500 million.

1,"NEW YORK -- Anyone who questions the remarkable relationship that binds the economy and the stock market should ponder briefly the circumstances that immediately preceded the recent surge in share prices. On July 31, the Commerce Department announced that its composite index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.9% in June. And on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points. Further steep increases followed, so that by last week's end the average was 102.81 points above its July 31 level.There's no short, simple explanation of the linkage between the economy and stock market. But any serious effort to appraise one's prospects entails close attention to the other. An obvious tie involves profits. If it becomes clear that a company's profits are on the rise, demand for its shares is likely to increase, tending to push up their price. A subtler connection involves interest rates. Securities that offer fixed rates of interest compete for investors' dollars with common stocks, which offer dividends that may rise or fall according to changes in profitability. When interest rates fall, this renders interest-paying securities relatively less attractive. It's no coincidence that in general before the recent market surge profits were sharply on the rise and interest rates on the decline.In all, a wide variety of factors can play upon the market. Among them are shifts in investor confidence, concern about rising or falling prices, worry over higher taxes or stiffer governmental regulations, changes in so-called margin requirements that limit what investors may borrow to buy stocks, the flow of money from overseas, major strikes and the failure of a large corporation. But business-cycle history leaves little doubt that the fundamental influence is the broad economic trend.The 0.9% drop in the Commerce Department's leading-indicator index in June has been widely interpreted as a signal that the economy, at the least, will grow at a slower pace in coming months. This, in turn, has been seen as a good reason to invest in common stocks, since a slower-paced expansion would presumably last longer and be accompanied by somewhat lower interest rates.The record shows, however, that a decline of only a month or two in the leading-indicator index by no means guarantees an economic slowing. In fact, the June drop was the first monthly decline since August 1982. Moreover, it's possible that subsequent revisions in the various components of the Commerce index may eventually turn the decline into an increase. Several times since August 1982 reported monthly declines in the index have indeed been revised into gains."

The large investment banking concern, which makes an annual survey, says that interest rates will tend to rise, at least during the first half of the year, because demand will exceed supply."
1,"CAN PRICES GO any lower in San Francisco? Will war benefit home sellers in Los Angeles? And how much more expensive will homes nationally be this year than last?The answers: Yes, maybe and just a bit, according to the most recent Home Price Forecast done by Case Shiller Weiss, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, for The Wall Street Journal. But while many industries across the country are still hurting from the recession, the economists think real estate may be leading the way back up. Home prices nationally will once again climb over the coming year, by an average of 2.8%. In fact, out of the 20 cities tracked, only two won't see prices rise, the forecasters say.Still, the upswing will be remarkably varied across the country, with some cities, such as San Diego, barely squeaking ahead (prices are expected to go up by just 0.8% there), while others, like Washington, D.C., should boast a robust jump of more than 7%. And though prices usually go up in the spring, Case Shiller Weiss predicts that in most places they won't climb until the second half of the year. ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" says the firm's Karl Case, who takes into account past sale prices, the number of homes on the market and the number of people setting up new households when making his predictions.Patrick and Sharon Brem discovered that for themselves when they recently tried to sell their loft in downtown San Francisco. That market has been one of the hardest hit in recent months and the economists say prices will drop by an additional 5.7% this year, making it the only city in the survey where they'll actually fall. The Brems were asking $969,000 for their place, but settled for $730,000 -- or exactly what they paid for it two years ago. ""We consider ourselves lucky to get out when we did,"" says Mrs. Brem, an Internet developer. A lot of people haven't been able to find buyers: The number of sales there fell by 27% in November from the year before.Home prices were flagging even before Sept. 11 -- in the first quarter of 2001, the National Association of Realtors found that prices had started downward in more than a quarter of the 128 major metro areas it tracks. And they were down in the immediate aftermath of the attacks -- September median new home prices dropped 5.1%, while those of existing homes fell 3.6%. But overall, the housing market has held its ground remarkably well despite the shaky economy, propped up by numerous interest-rate cuts and consumer faith in the housing market. During the third quarter of last year, inflation-adjusted prices nationally rose 6.1% from a year earlier, according to the federal government."
