WASHINGTON -- Good news concerning the U.S. economy continued last week as the October unemployment rate dropped a notch to its lowest level in 29 years and wage gains remained tame."Job growth was solid, but wage pressures were completely absent in October," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. "The inflation threat has receded yet again."The new numbers, combined with some signs the economy may be slowing, will bolster those inside the Federal Reserve arguing against an interest-rate increase when policy makers meet Nov. 16.The anemic growth in wages, in particular, gives Fed officials more breathing room to see whether the economy is slowing on its own, or whether growth can continue at the current pace without sparking inflation."The Fed will probably be on hold until March 21, 2000," said Rosanne Cahn, chief U.S. equity economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, describing what she calls "benign wage inflation." Still, many analysts think the Fed will move next week.	['1']	['1']	[0.842968225479126]

Recently, companies that pay large dividends have been shunned in favor of more speculative businesses whose shareholders expect to be rewarded with strong capital appreciation down the road. But the plunge in share prices over the last month may have tempered that outlook a bit, and at such the demand for big dividend payers tends to increase, as investors seek comfort in those quarterly payments. While some analysts and fund managers foresee more weakness for such stocks, others are encouraging investors to give them another look. "Dividend payers outperform when the market goes down," said James H. Huguet, president of Great Companies Funds in Clearwater, Fla. And such a time is not far off, he predicted.

CHICAGO'S Federal Reserve bank takes a fresh look at Midwest manufacturing . . . and gulps a bit at what it finds.Measuring ups and downs in employment is the usual way of tracking manufacturing activity. But this method ignores such important factors as the value added in the production process and the speed at which factory equipment is used.With the Federal Reserve Board's monthly Industrial Production Index as a guide, economists at the Chicago Fed came up with a Midwest Manufacturing Index to measure factory output in the bank's five-state district -- Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin.Unfortunately, the first tabulation shows Midwest manufacturing activity for June up just 1.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 3.6% increase for the U.S. as a whole. A revised computation for the first eight months of 1987 put Midwest manufacturing up 2.3%, against 3.5% for the nation."I'm not overly concerned," says Chicago Fed economist Robert Schnorbus. "We're going through a phase of the recovery where our major industries are in a fairly slow expansion phase. One thing helping us is steel, which is getting close to full capacity. It's the major industry in our region right now."	['1']	['1']	[0.9926286935806274]
Economic growth in Virginia, which began to accelerate in the early 1980s, continued to outperform the nation in 1985, according to a University of Virginia study.The state's gross state product (GSP), which measures the value of the goods and services produced and is the state-level equivalent to the gross national product (GNP), totaled $95 billion in 1985, compared with $87 billion the previous year, the study reported.The real GSP, adjusted for inflation, totaled $84.7 billion in 1985, a 5.1 percent increase over the comparable 1984 period. The GNP increased about 2.7 percent in 1985, or about half the growth Virginia experienced."Historically, this increase is considerably above the average," said Robert W. Cox, who conducted the study for the Tayloe Murphy Institute. "Virginia has been growing faster than the United States over time since about 1958. But, since 1981, it has expanded at a much greater rate," he said.Since the Tayloe Murphy Institute first began keeping records in 1958, the real GSP has grown at an average annual rate of 3.8 percent, compared with a 3 percent average increase in the GNP.

Wall Street economists and money managers spent the long holiday weekend keeping close watch on the effects of Hurricane Katrina, with many saying that, despite the devastation, the long-term impact on U.S. and global economic growth should be muted.But several analysts also warned that global stock, bond, currency and commodities markets may react sharply in the coming days and weeks to any signs of prolonged energy supply disruption, depressed consumer spending or rapidly rising unemployment."The economic and market implications of Katrina, and her ugly aftermath, remain highly problematic," Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG-Hoenig, wrote in a report to clients over the weekend. "Most obviously, a slower trajectory for global growth now seems unavoidable. . . . U.S. consumer spending will take a hit in the months ahead."Several Wall Street firms reduced their predictions for U.S. economic growth in the second half of the year, citing the impact of gas prices on consumer spending and the disruption of commodity shipments through the critical ports at the mouth of the Mississippi. Credit Suisse First Boston, for instance, reduced its estimated gross domestic product growth for the third quarter from 3.7 percent to 3 percent.William C. Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs & Co., wrote in a research note that the reduction in economic output should be limited to the next few months. But he said such an outcome was not guaranteed. "The worst-case scenario is if the drop in consumer spending leads to significant [enough] job losses to push the unemployment rate materially higher. That could be sufficient to generate the type of dynamics that culminate in recession."	['1']	['0']	[0.8327680230140686]

With a tone of despair, New York hanker Robert V. Roosa, sometimes mentioned as a possible successor to Arthur F. Burns at the Federal Reserve, makes a sarcastic reference to the sinking dollar and what he terms the "benign neglect" policy of the U.S. government.Roosa wants the United States, West Germany, and Japan to intervene in foreign exchange markets to support agreed-upon rates for the Big Three nations' currencies. Burns himself, in his best stentorian tones, warns a congressional committee that we dare not be complacent about the current depreciating tendencies of the dollar.Burns' concerns now are echoed routinely by Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, who in every speech and congressional appearance swears on a stack of Bibles that he is not trying to depress the dollar to get a competitive advantage for U.S. exports.

Even with offsetting surpluses on services, the net current account deficit will be about $18 billion this year.	['0']	['0']	[0.9206423759460449]

These findings would shock the smiling bulls."People aren't really looking at the data," Mr. Bernstein says.

Continued strains in the labor market are weighing on Federal Reserve officials more than recent turmoil in Europe, their public comments Thursday suggested.Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart indicated that the central bank may raise interest rates even if joblessness remains high. "[G]ood policy, even in circumstances of unacceptable levels of unemployment, may incorporate higher interest rates."Mr. Lockhart, whose views tend to mirror the consensus on the Fed's policy committee, said "the time is approaching when it will be appropriate" for the Fed to consider raising rates, but that time hasn't arrived yet. "However, as the economy continues to improve and financial markets find firmer ground, extraordinarily low policy rates will not be needed...will become inconsistent with maintaining price stability."He acknowledged that the European concerns "have added to uncertainty" in financial markets. But neither he nor other Fed officials who spoke Thursday suggested Europe is a predominant concern. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Thomas Hoenig said the situation in Europe "reminds us to be wary," and noted the shift from riskier assets "will have a modest negative net effect on U.S. economic growth in the near term."But the officials' comments suggested that the path for interest rates hadn't been altered much by recent developments overseas.

The White House says the recession is over, and the anecdotal evidence suggests a recovery has begun. The lackluster response in financial markets, however, suggests widespread doubts that policy makers in Washington have a clue about how to sustain a recovery.Specifically, markets have to be wondering about the delay in reappointing Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Colin Powell's first term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expires in the autumn, and President Bush announced his reappointment a month ago. Mr. Greenspan's four-year term expires in a month, but Mr. Bush has made no announcement. Meanwhile, various aides, deputies and kibitzers tell reporters that the delay is an attempt to "leverage" the Fed to ease interest rates further.This sounds all too much like the same advisers who urged Mr. Bush to raise taxes three months into this recession. Having abandoned their own control over fiscal policy, these advisers have since taken to lecturing Mr. Greenspan and the Fed on monetary policy. This is graceless at the least, but also probably dangerous; financial markets can see when stones are being thrown from glass houses in Washington.Especially since Mr. Greenspan is the one U.S. official who has built some credibility in world markets lately. Amid the capital's fiscal gridlock, the Fed has had to steer the economy with its single monetary oar, and with fair results. The Fed has brought down long-term interest rates, which are the decisive rates for investment. It's done this without reigniting inflation, which except during Paul Volcker's Fed tenure, has been the expectation before every presidential election cycle.It's true that, at 8.5% or so, long-term interest rates remain stubbornly high. But this isn't something the Fed can easily control. The Fed in the short run can dictate the fed-funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. And the Greenspan Fed has done this, dropping fed-funds to 5.75% April 30.	['1']	['0']	[0.8432714343070984]
The nation's jobless rate dropped slightly to 6.4 percent in December, and the number of jobs nationwide increased modestly--news that the financial markets and economists viewed as reassuring signs that economic growth would be steady but not strong enough to revive inflation.The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since early 1991, down from 6.5 percent in November, the government reported yesterday. The November number, however, was revised upward from 6.4 percent initially reported a month ago. The adjustment was made to reflect seasonal variations.The reports from the Labor Department were read as good news, partly because the prospect of moderate growth helped ease fears that the Federal Reserve Board would increase short-term interest rates to control inflation."The economy is on track for steady economic growth in 1994," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. She noted that pressures that could lead to inflation appeared to be "tame."Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist with Merrill Lynch & Co., said the Labor Department's unemployment release "is another good report in indicating that there really aren't significant inflationary pressures in the economy."

WASHINGTON -- The nation's merchandise trade deficit, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, narrowed in the first quarter, but the improvement was restrained by rising import prices, government figures show.The quarterly gap stood at $38.33 billion, compared with a revised $38.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Previously, the department put the fourth quarter deficit at $38.37 billion.The value of imports increased 1% to $96.54 billion in the latest quarter after rising 2.1% to $95.62 billion in the third period. The first-quarter figures reflected a 3% drop in volume and a 4% increase in prices, however, the department said."It's another one of those reports in which imports grow a little and prices are up quite a bit," said David Hartman, senior economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "The slow improvement that we have forseen still looks like it's on target."Imports of auto parts from Japan and Mexico grew strongly; other increases included building materials, textile products and capital goods other than aircraft. Imports of petroleum and related products rose 8.5% to $8.69 billion after increasing 1.4% to $8.01 billion in the fourth quarter. By volume, oil shipments fell to 6.09 million barrels a day from 6.9 million; the average price of a barrel rose to $15.63 from $12.74.	['1']	['1']	[0.8976165056228638]

NEW YORK -- As Wall Street's fortunes continue to sag, First Boston Corp. said it plans to lay off nearly 200 employees this week.The latest dismissals reflect First Boston's falling revenue from stock and bond trading. They come amid sinking profits throughout the securities industry, where as many as 17,000 people have lost their jobs since the October 1987 stock market crash, according to some estimates.With the latest layoffs, First Boston, a unit of closely held CS First Boston Inc., will have slashed its work force by 1,000 since the crash, through firings and attrition, First Boston officials said. The 200 layoffs are concentrated in the corporate, municipal and mortgage bond departments and the common and preferred stock units. These areas have been especially hard hit by rising interest rates and low trading volumes during the past 18 months.Wall Street has gone from sweeping layoffs at some big firms right after the 1987 crash to a pattern of steady, less significant employee cutbacks in recent months. "The bloodletting will continue," Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp., said. "There appears to be a general policy on Wall Street that says: Cut when times are tough, because you can always get back into a business when times are better."He estimated that as many as 6,000 highly paid traders, salesmen and investment bankers have lost their jobs and haven't been replaced since the 1987 crash.

For investors seeking strong and steady returns, one commodity stands tall in terms of recent performance: exchange membership seats.The price of doing business on most major U.S. futures exchanges has jumped this year, reflecting a 15% rise in futures trading and a 30% rise in options volume compared with the first half of 1986.The seat-price surge continues a pattern that began nearly two years ago, when the weakening of the U.S. dollar started to cause some concern about a renewal of inflation. That concern triggered brisk activity on the commodity exchanges, and now many commodity prices, after sluggish activity stemming from a 6 1/2-year bear market, appear to have bottomed out.Many investors "are convinced commodity prices have begun to move," John Urbanchuk, an economist for Wharton Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says.

WASHINGTON--Sales of new homes surged in June despite higher mortgage rates, maintaining momentum for a key sector driving the economic recovery.New-home sales increased 8.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 497,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the highest level since May 2008. Sales were up 38% from a year earlier.The sales jump comes amid a sharp escalation in mortgage rates, which began rising in late May. The average for a 30-year fixed-rate loan is now up about one percentage point from its recent low to 4.58%, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data also released Wednesday. That's down from 4.68% a week earlier."The increase in mortgage rates over the past two months does not appear to have dented new-home sales, at least not yet," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. He cited pent-up demand, a better labor market and stronger consumer confidence as factors behind the sales boost.Mortgage rates can hit new-home sales more quickly than sales of previously owned homes because the new-home figures are measured when a buyer signs a contract to purchase a new home. Existing-home sales figures reflect closings 30 to 60 days later, on average, after a contract is signed.	['1']	['0']	[0.8946613669395447]
[Financial Analysis and Commentary]Doubtless America would be better off if Europe got its house in order. Last year, the euro-zone sovereign-debt crisis hammered confidence, particularly on Wall Street. But there are ways that Europe's woes actually are providing a boost to the U.S.First, Europe's weakening growth -- alongside a Chinese slowdown -- has sapped global demand for commodities. Lower raw-material prices are helping cut company costs and cap inflation. That oil prices have been moving sideways despite Iran threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz is a minor miracle. Americans can take a moment to thank their friends in Europe when gassing up the SUV.Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering doggedly around 2%. Lately, that seems less to do with the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep rates ultralow through next year than it does with nervous foreign investors rushing into dollar-denominated debt as they seek a safe haven.Low U.S. interest rates have helped bolster the availability of credit, supporting demand for everything from capital equipment to cars to washing machines to -- wait for it -- even houses.

NEW YORK, Feb, 24 (UPI) Overdue profit taking, fueled by recession news, drove the stock market to its worst loss in more than two months today in moderately active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.The Dow Jones industrial average, a 15-point winner last week, fell 12.83 to 736.94, its worst loss since it dropped 15.64 on Dec. 2.

The dollar's current weakness does not stem from an inability to attract international capital: indeed, the United States is probably attracting too much capital for its state of development. During 1977, on a net basis, the United States borrowed about $20 billion overseas. Though much of these borrowings were involuntary, reflecting the effortsto bolster the dollar through exchange-market intervention, some capital was attracted to the United States by the security of investment here and the relatively high rate of return.

IN RECENT weeks it has become more and more obvious that the tight credit policy was losing its justification as a counter - inflationary measure. However, the timing of last week's decision to reduce the Federal Reserve discount rate carried considerable significance.The weekly Dorsey statements of the banks in principal cities have made it clear that the demand by business for bank loans has been quite sluggish in the past few months, after making allowance for the usual seasonal tendencies of the late summer and autumn. But there has been a continued demand for funds in the capital markets. Consequently, interest rates have been only slightly below the recent highs which have been around the highest rates in over 20 years.The latest rate for new 91-day Treasury Bills was about 3.47 per cent, only slightly below the then prevailing discount rate of 3.5 per cent and well above the new discount rate of 3 per cent. Jn theory, the new condition would seem to encourage member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve Banks at 3 per cent and use the funds to buy bills at 3.45 per cent, which would, of course, tend to expand bank credit.A reduction of the discount rate below the bill rate is a most unusual development, in fact, I cannot find a duplication of it in the record of the past 25 years.THE MOVE is all the more startling because public remarks made by FRB Chairman Martin only about two w'eeks ago were bluntly in defense of the tight credit policy, and his observations then would seem to justify the public's interpretation that the tight credit policy was likely to continue.

Economists and government officials are increasingly worried that in its efforts to restrain the U.S. economy's current boom, the Federal Reserve may boost interest rates so much that it produces a mild bust next year or in 1996.The Fed, which has already raised interest rates six times this year in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the red-hot economy, could act again at a policy-making session today. But analysts said the central bank is more likely to wait until it meets next on Jan. 31.Many analysts now predict that to curb the economy's robust growth, the Fed will have to provide such a harsh dose of interest rate medicine - raising short-term interest rates at least a percentage point on top of this year's increases of 2.5 percentage points - that it will eventually plunge the economy into recession."There is less and less chance of a soft landing and a higher and higher chance of the more traditional boom-and-bust cycle," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.In its latest forecast, Merrill Lynch & Co. said last week that strong economic growth in early 1995 could lead the Fed to raise rates "by more than we currently expect. In that case, the U.S. economy would probably decelerate more sharply by late 1995 and possibly into a recession in 1996."	['1']	['0']	[0.6859439015388489]
5.8 percent level of pay settlements negotiated last year. That may sound surprising since Government statistics show that the average wage-earner has been losing the race with inflation in the last year. What the worker could buy with his weekly take-home pay after allowing for higher prices and taxes left him 3 percent worse off than he had been at the start of 1973. There is no expectation in labor circles that inflation will climb at less than the 8.8 percent clip of last year. The much more prevalent view is thatconsumer prices will shoot up by 10 percent or more this year. Why then is there still no audible clamor for a return to ever-larger pay increases?

A burst of higher inflation is fueling debate about whether the Federal Reserve should move sooner to reduce its support for the U.S. economy than currently anticipated.Consumer prices rose 0.4% in May from a month earlier, the most in more than a year, the Labor Department said.

But the central bank prefers a separate measure -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumption expenditures -- that has shown less-dramatic price increases and inflation still running below its target, at 1.6% in April.Still, both measures suggest inflation picked up in the spring after two years of sluggishness.

WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's composite index of leading indicators slipped in September for the fourth straight month, signaling that the economic soft patch will persist.Separately, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped by an unexpectedly steep 25,000 last week, a decline that may have been skewed by the holiday-shortened week.The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, reported that its composite index of leading indicators fell by 0.1% to a reading of 115.6 in September, after August's 0.3% decline. The slightness of the declines in the past four months seems to argue against invoking the economists' rule of thumb that three consecutive declines in the index signal a recession."While the leading index is not yet signaling a downturn, the growth rate of the leading index has slowed," said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board. Economic growth should continue, but more slowly than expected, he added. The index is designed to predict the economy's path during the next three to six months.Oil prices have had a negative impact on the economy, but not enough to produce a broad spike in inflation. Recent hurricanes may also have held down economic activity, the Conference Board said.	['0']	['0']	[0.9305375218391418]
The Federal Reserve affirmed its plan to keep interest rates "exceptionally low" for a long time despite signs of economic recovery. But the Fed began to lay rhetorical groundwork for an eventual shift in its stance, suggesting that when the unemployment rate falls or if expectations of inflation turn up, it could change course."Economic activity has continued to pick up," the Fed said in a statement following a two-day meeting. It noted that consumer spending has improved, housing activity has increased and businesses were retrenching at a slower pace.Fed officials voted unanimously to maintain their target for the key federal-funds interest rate -- at which banks lend to each other overnight -- near zero and said they expect to keep it there for an "extended period," which suggested increases are at least several months off.Central banks in smaller economies -- such as Australia, Israel and Norway -- have started raising interest rates. But the Fed made clear the U.S. economy isn't nearly strong enough to begin moving in that direction, even though the economy grew at a 3.5% rate in the third quarter and is expected to keep growing into 2010.While consumers are spending, the Fed noted they were "constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit." Meanwhile, "businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace."	['1']	['0']	[0.9718145728111267]

NEW YORK -- New construction contracts climbed a seasonally adjusted 12% in January from the previous month, reflecting improved weather conditions, F.W. Dodge Co. said.In its monthly survey of construction-contract activity, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. said new construction in January totaled $13.75 billion. The rebound "seemed to confirm that the unusually severe weather early in the winter upset the seasonal rhythm of the construction business," said George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge.Mr. Christie noted that when the January and December contract totals are averaged, the rate of activity has been nearly level since last summer, when interest rates stabilized. "Whether constuction activity advances or recedes from this plateau will depend mostly on the next development in the credit market," he said.Residential building contracts were particularly strong in the January rebound, Dodge said. The value of contracts for one-family homes, apartments and condominiums, hotels and motels was $6.6 billion in January, up 16% on a seasonally adjusted basis.Nonresidential building contracts, particularly for factories, warehouses and offices, also rebounded sharply in January, rising an adjusted 14% in January to $5.3 billion after an 8% decline in December.

Our leading financial institutions announced that they had actually made a profit in the year's first quarter through the creative manipulation of rules and regulations, lobbied Congress to preserve their ability to raise credit card interest rates just for the heck of it and opposed the administration's plan for restructuring Chrysler, which would save some jobs and honor pension obligations, in the hope that they can redeem the company's bonds at a higher level than they're trading at just now. And, to round out the picture, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that lending at the 19 largest TARP recipients was 23 percent lower in February -- by which time these banks had received hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds intended to enable them to lend more -- than it had been in October, before the floodgates of tax dollars had been fully opened.The week began with a burst of creative accounting. Citigroup, into which we've sunk more dough than any other company, with the possible exception of AIG, claimed a profit for the first quarter of this year because its bonded debt has lost value, which under the rules of accountancy enabled it to register a one-time gain equal to that lost value, because Citi could, in theory, buy back its own bonds for less. J.P. Morgan Chase, whose fire-sale purchase of Bear Stearns we taxpayers backed, declared a similar profit because of a similar decline in the value of its bonds.As events would have it, the very same Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are the lead negotiators for the banks that are objecting to the Obama administration's efforts to restructure Chrysler. Chrysler's bonds, which these banks hold, are trading at 15 cents on the dollar, the amount the government offered to pay the banks in its initial proposal to restore the company to viability. Yesterday, the government upped that amount to 22 cents, plus a 5 percent equity share in the company. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, however, insist that they and their fellow banks are entitled to more, though that "more" could only come at the expense of Fiat (the auto company that is providing the new car lines and technology without which Chrysler will fold) or the company's retirees (to whose health-care fund Chrysler is legally obligated) who built the company, or the taxpayers who are keeping Chrysler alive.Instead of playing Scrooge (and a publicly subsidized Scrooge, at that), what the banks should do is lend Chrysler their accountants. Maybe they'd show that the company turned a profit last year.The banks' lobbyists, meanwhile, have been hard at work, too. Bills to limit credit card fees and penalties -- my favorite fee is the one banks charge some customers for making (not missing, making) a payment -- are moving through both houses of Congress, but the Senate version has yet to receive any support from Republicans. A bill that would enable bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms has also hit a wall in the Senate, with Republican leaders claiming the backing of all 41 of their members to filibuster the bill when it comes to the floor.

Credit-ratings firms say they plan to delay issuing any credit-rating downgrades to the largest U.S. banks as a result of new financial regulation.Moody's Investors Service analysts on Thursday said that, under the overhaul bill passed by the Senate last month, the government still has some room to bail out the biggest banks, at least in the short term -- an option it will likely choose as long as the economy and markets are unsettled."Consequently, we expect that the senior debt and deposit ratings of systemically important banks in the U.S. will continue to benefit from unusual levels of support," Moody's analysts wrote in a report, "until the economic recovery is sustained, financial market health is restored, and the risks of attempting to unwind an interconnected institution are reduced."Moody's didn't specify which banks it considers systemically important, but the short list likely includes Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.The Moody's Corp. unit and McGraw-Hill Cos.' Standard & Poor's in the past have warned that the government's implied support of banks considered to big to fail means they get higher credit ratings than they otherwise would, usually between one and five notches. The ratings companies have said that any overhaul bill undercutting that support could result in downgrades.	['0']	['1']	[0.5114927291870117]

Regardless of any mitigating qualifications that may be read into it, the unemployment of 6 per cent of the national labor force in December is a sobering commentary on the economic transition through which the United States is passing. Undoubtedly it does reflect in part the winding down of the war in Vietnam. In larger measure it is a product of the economic slowdown deliberately brought about to curb an alarming rise in inflation. The specific cause in any particular case will not lessen the distress of jobless families, however, and that distress is now sufficiently widespread to make corrective measures imperative.The classical method of dealing with inflation has always had an ironic twist. The curtailment of economic activity to relieve the upward pressure on prices has exacted sacrifices from those least able to bear them. This time, moreover, the irony has multiplied. While 4.6 million unemployed are tightening their belts because of the scarcity of jobs, millions of other workers are taking advantage of the continued inflation to boost their incomes, with little or no regard for what the general consequences may be.In addition to this special toll exacted from people who lose their jobs, the economic trends of the last year have been rough on a large majority of wage earners. Hourly pay has advanced over the last year by 5.8 per cent, but the cost of living in November was 5.6 per cent above the figure a year ago. In other words, almost the entire increase was eaten up by higher prices, with no allowance for the rise in worker productivity, which is now increasing again.last year. Department of Labor statistics for the first nine months of 1970, the latest available, show a mean wage and benefit package adjustment of 10 per cent a year. The average first-year wage and benefit change during that same period amounted to 14.7 per cent a year. Economists recognize these exorbitant wage increases in some key industries as a leading cause of continued inflation even in the face of lax economic activity.One segment of labor, the unemployed, is taking a severe drubbing from the current economic situation while another, the large powerful unions, is riding the crest of excessive benefits for its own members. The sacrifice imposed on workers at the bottom of the scale for the sake of attaining a stable economy is proving to be ineffective in part because of the extraordinary power exerted by other labor groups at the top of the scale.

In fact, when one passes from Mr. Reagan's campaign statements to his list of economic advisers, it becomes clear what his anti-inflationary policy is likely to be. The advisers are many of the same group who persuaded previous Republican Presidents to apply the recession cure and thereby produce the economic downturns of 1953, 1958, 1960 and 1974. (The 1969 downturn was largely the respon- sibility of the preceding Democratic Administration.) If the anti-inflationary policy of a Reagan Administration is to differ from that of Mr. Carter, it will merely be that, in the words of the Reagan advisers, the recession cure will be applied more quickly and allowed to continue longer.

It's the best of times. It's the scariest of times. Last year, U.S. exports, industrial production, real hourly compensation, corporate profits, federal tax revenues, retail sales, GDP, productivity, the number of people with jobs, the number of students in college, airline passenger traffic and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all hit record levels. For the third consecutive year, global growth was strong, continuing to lift (and hold) millions of people out of poverty. From 30,000 feet, heck from 1,000 feet, it sure looks like the best of times.In relative terms, the first five years of the current recovery have been much better than the first five years of the 1990s recovery. But all this has not softened the pessimism of many pundits and politicians who are either unimpressed or expect the whole thing to come crashing down any minute. That is, unless the government firmly grabs the reins of the global economy and steers it clear of disaster.Many believe that the debate is over on global warming, nationalized health care, tax hikes, rich-versus-poor, the trade deficit and "obscene" oil company profits. Forgotten in this rush to pass judgment on capitalism is the fact that the last two times government seriously tried to control the U.S. economy -- in the 1930s and in the 1970s -- they made a terrible mess of it.In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act caused a collapse in global trade, while the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by one- third. Government regulation in the 1920s prevented banks from branching, which caused more than 10,000 to fail in the 1930s, deepening and prolonging the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover's tax hikes were icing on the cake, capping off a perfect storm of D.C. policy mistakes.It took another 35 years, and a nice run of prosperity, but Washington finally gathered the courage to try this again. Between 1965 and 1981, Great Society welfare and health-care programs, wage and price controls, inflationary Fed policy, 70% marginal tax rates, 50% capital-gains tax rates, and highly regulated energy, airline, banking and trucking industries created severe problems.

They put their case gently and politely to Sen. Vance Hartke (D-Ind.), who has proposed, along with Rep. James A. Mac-kay (D-Ga.) in the House, amendments that toughen the Administration bill.Mr. Nader is a singularly American phenomenon the gadfly, the reformer with a singleness of purpose that gives him the strength of 10. So concentrated is his aim on the engineering safety of the car that even his backers on Capitol Hill are concerned lest other factors in the slaughter on the highways be lost sight of. And that slaughter is just now the reason for renewed agonizing.THE CURVE of death and destruction had been going down. But for the first four months of this year 15,110 persons were killed as compared with 13,650 in the same period in 1965, an increase of 11 per cent. The jump in April with 4400 traffic fatalities was 20 per cent over April a year ago. So ominous is the rise that the president of the National Safety Council, Howard Pyle, warned of totals of tragedy far beyond anything in automotive history. This will help the push for a strong Federal safety standards bill. Whether the responsibility lies with the states or with the Federal Government is one of the bones of contention. For the industry state laws would be less of a problem, and until recently the claim of states' rights might have been a convenient refuge from Federal regulation. But a special highway safety panel of the National Governors Conference meeting in Washington reported that auto safety standards were a Federal responsibility.	['0']	['0']	[0.9510029554367065]

For people who always like to have something to worry about, here's the trendy new worry for 1998. Price deflation. What would happen to businesses, jobs and the stock market if average consumer prices dropped?The answer: Things could be just fine. Obsessive brooders should exercise their worry beads over something else.The consumer price index (CPI) falls when enough businesses cut the prices on things they sell, or when prices decline sharply for a couple of major items within the index.The 12-month inflation rate is running at 1.8 percent. Prices rose modestly for most goods and services, but energy and automobiles showed declines.This kind of selective price cutting goes on all the time without hurting the economy, says Irwin Kellner, president of Kellner Economic Advisers in Port Washington, N.Y.

RICHMOND, March 2 Fierce winter weather and the full impact of the national recession delivered a one-two punch to Virginia in January, sending the state's unemployment rate to a post-World War II high of 7.8 percent.But for those who are out of work, there was an encouraging word; Gov.

Designed to blunt criticism of ever-higher fees, the new cards - - with names like "Simplicity" and "Clear" -- still can ding late payers. After extolling its new features, Citibank's Simplicity card offer warns that late payments could trigger an increase in the interest rate charged on balances as well as a negative credit report. Such reports often cause other lenders to boost interest rates on a consumer's other outstanding debts.American Express Co.'s Clear card will increase a user's interest rate to 28.74 percent if a consumer pays late twice a year.David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a newsletter that monitors the credit card industry, said he thinks the new cards could be attractive to consumers fed up with punitive fees. However, he warns, the $39 late fees that are currently assessed may add up to far less than the hundreds of dollars in extra interest consumers would have to pay over time if the interest rates on their outstanding balances increase. "It's yet to be proven that consumers read the fine print," he said.Pennsylvania attorney Michael J. Bresnahan did read the details when he received his Citibank solicitation last week, and his reaction wasn't positive. "What a deal, no late fee and the interest on the balance goes to somewhere in the 29 percent range," Bresnahan wrote in an e-mail. "Appalling."Bresnahan said he has no choice in accepting the card; Citibank said it was sending it to him, whether he wants it or not, to replace an existing card. But, he said, "I'm certainly not going to pay late; that's an invitation to disaster."	['1']	['0']	[0.8343493938446045]

As the U.S. economy inches toward the "fiscal cliff," the country's small banks are approaching a cliff of their own, in a development that could pinch short-term lending rates.On Jan. 1, a program that insures an unlimited amount of money in non-interest-bearing accounts will expire unless Washington moves to extend it. Without the Transaction Account Guarantee program, or TAG, an insurance cap resets to $250,000, affecting about $1.6 trillion in deposits.And without insurance protection, depositors may be compelled to move amounts above $250,000 to other venues deemed safer, leaving the banks with less business.J.P. Morgan estimates that, of that total, $579 billion could be on the move.Big financial firms would be on the receiving end of these flows, where cash would either be moved into the perceived safer hands of larger banks or earn a sliver of interest at a conservative money fund. Safety is a big concern for investors as the federal government faces the potential "fiscal cliff," a set of tax increases and spending cuts that kick in on Jan. 1 if lawmakers can't reach a compromise plan, and which could send the economy into recession.

Inflation took an unexpected leap in August as sharply higher energy prices and housing costs sent the consumer price index up 0.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.It was the largest increase in the price index since January's 0.7 percent rise.

In 1986, the index rose 1.1 percent.Analysts said it was unlikely that prices would spiral quickly upward during the rest of the year, but cautioned that the weak inflation rates of 1986 are gone.

NEW YORK -- Investors who bought U.S. Treasury bonds this year have booked modest returns. But the folks who trade the government's debt are losing their shirts.Although $100 billion of Treasury securities are bought and sold daily on Wall Street, making the Treasury bond market by far the single biggest securities market in the world, most bond traders can't make any money.The problem: Too many bond dealers chasing too few customers have squeezed profit margins to the bare bones. Ten years ago, a dealer typically could expect to make a $1,250 profit on a $1 million trade of Treasury notes, said Richard M. Kelly, president of bond dealer Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. Now, that profit has shrunk to just $312.50, he said.Nowhere is the suffering worse than at the nation's primary dealers, an elite group of big commercial banks and brokerage firms that buy and sell government bonds directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as it executes monetary policy. They also are required to step up and buy bonds at every Treasury auction of government securities; the dealers try to quickly resell the securities."It's a very tough business," said Thomas Pura, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and chairman of the government securities division at the Public Securities Association, a trade group. "Spreads really are razor-thin."	['0']	['1']	[0.9941092729568481]

But he estimated that each percentage-point cut in the inflation rate by reducing total demand would cost $200 billion in lost output.	['0']	['0']	[0.9107025861740112]

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. boosted its August sales-growth forecast and said it may post its largest monthly sales gain in more than a year, a sign that consumer spending continues to accelerate despite setbacks such as the blackout that struck much of the Northeast and Midwest two weeks ago.The world's largest retailer said sales at stores open more than a year should increase 4% to 6%, somewhat better than its previous estimate of 3% to 5%. Although modest, the sales gains would be the largest such increase for the retailing giant in more than a year.The improved forecast is the latest evidence that a nascent economic recovery is under way. Although battered by terrorism, war and economic uncertainty following the collapse of the Internet bubble, consumer spending has been a mainstay of the weak U.S. economy, fueled most recently by low interest rates that sparked a home-refinancing boom.Wal-Mart attributed the improved forecast to a greater-than-expected number of shoppers and larger average purchases, bolstered by a cut in tax withholding and tax-refund checks of as much as $400 a child."People seem to be more inclined to shop right now," said Tom Williams, a spokesman for the Bentonville, Ark., discount retailer.

The stock market has been on a rocket ride the last seven months, gaining some 22%. But is there enough fuel to keep flying this high?Judging by the $5.9 billion that has flowed into equity mutual funds so far this month, there's still plenty of oomph left. And that doesn't include a vast pool of money waiting in what amounts to an untapped storage tank.Robert Adler of AMG Data Service, which provided the mutual-fund figures, says it is the largest amount of cash to come into the funds since early January, when investors put in $7 billion. The evidence suggests that interest in investing is widespread, adds Mr. Adler. He points out that of the 10 largest inflows to individual funds, six were into Fidelity funds, which have a large retail component.Money is also coming into the market through increased investments by pension funds, through company stock buybacks and individual stock buying.Pension-fund figures supplied by Employee Benefit Research Institute also show that more money has gone into stocks in the first quarter this year than in the same period last year. EBRI says $31 billion has gone into stocks in defined-benefit packages, or almost 7% more than last year, and $46 billion, or almost 10% more, in defined-contribution plans.

Taper' Doesn't Have to Stop House PartyHome isn't where the Fed is.Thanks to its extraordinary efforts to boost the economy, namely by buying hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage bonds and Treasury debt, the Federal Reserve has engineered a rebound in housing markets. With the central bank now set to scale back its measures -- possibly as soon as next month -- and interest rates already having risen in anticipation, the worry is the party may come to a premature end.Last week, numbers showed a surprise slide in new-home sales in July. This week could bring another bad signal should Wednesday's pending-home-sales data for July disappoint.Analysts expect that the index from the National Association of Realtors will slip less than 1% from the previous month, while remaining up more than 7% year over year. The fear: A jump in interest rates will have sent far more home buyers to the sidelines. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has risen by a percentage point in little more than three months, to 4.58% as of last Thursday, according to Freddie Mac.

For homeowners, these are the best of times. The economy has been expanding for 27 consecutive quarters. Over the past year, the stock market peaked and consumer confidence reached its highest level in 28 years. Mortgage interest and unemployment rates are the lowest they have been in decades. Real wages -- at least for the better-off -- are rising, and government coffers are overflowing. Even crime rates are down.So it is only natural that home sales are breaking records and prices are beating inflation.That's the conclusion of the latest Home Price Forecast, prepared for The Wall Street Journal by the economic research firm Case Shiller Weiss Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. The forecast reflects actual price changes in 10 of the largest metropolitan areas from August 1996 to August 1997 and projects figures to January 1999.Not everyone feels like celebrating, however. In Chicago, where the economists predict the lowest price rises of the 10 metro areas, home prices are just keeping pace with inflation and houses are languishing on the market. "I've lowered my price $10,000, and there still have been no offers," says retired publisher Frank Albergo, whose 2,000-square-foot, turreted Norman-style home has been on the market for more than a year. It is currently listed at $239,000.San Francisco, by contrast, is expected to remain the country's hottest and the most expensive housing market. Susan Sparks, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, expects a quick sale of her 2,046-square-foot tract home, recently listed for $205,000. She says 15 homes in her development have sold in the past six months, some "for their full listing price in two weeks or less."	['1']	['1']	[0.9893418550491333]

CHICAGO -- Plenty of Americans know that Japanese investors have gobbled up Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and New York's Rockefeller Center. But with less fanfare, the Japanese are also pouring money into trading in the booming U.S. financial futures markets.It was only three years ago that Japanese securities firms began buying seats on Chicago's Board of Trade and Mercantile Exchange, the two biggest U.S. futures markets. Since then, Japanese trading here has increased sharply.The Japanese may already account for as much as 40% of the volume in the bustling Eurodollar pit at the Chicago Merc, where financial futures based on the fluctuation of short-term interest rates are traded. Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Merc's executive committee, has predicted that by 1992 a third of the Merc's total volume will come from the Japanese.Yet while financial markets in Japan at times are given to speculation, Japanese tastes here tend toward futures based on bonds and interest rates, contracts frequently used to hedge the risk of relatively conservative fixed-income investments like U.S. Treasury bonds."Certainly, Japanese investors have invested heavily in U.S. Treasury bonds and related futures, but not much in U.S. equities or the corresponding futures," said Nobuaki Ohmura, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc., a unit of one of the "Big Four" Japanese securities firms.

The nation's central bank yesterday pushed a key interest rate lower in an effort to put more steam into an economy that has not yet broken free of recession.The Federal Reserve Board added reserves to the nation's banking system, thus lowering the federal funds rate - the interest banks charge to borrow money from each other overnight - to 5.5 percent, down from the 5.75 percent rate that has been the Fed's target since April, economists and market analysts said.Wall Street reacted favorably to the rate cut, with stocks recording their biggest gains in more than a month. The Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks climbed 38.24 point, or 1.3 percent. {Details on Page C9.}Although the Fed does not announce changes in the federal funds target, its action was widely interpreted as a signal of a basic shift in policy, economists said. The central bank now appears more concerned with preventing a second economic slump - a "double-dip recession" - than it is about keeping a tight lid on inflation."The fear that the recovery is not happening weighs heavier than the fear of inflation," said Stephanie Murphy, economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York.

FED AND BUSH OFFICIALS hold their breath for evidence of recovery.Signs of life in manufacturing and home sales cheer economic officials, but this morning's unemployment report is crucial. Financial markets anticipate a slight increase in employment. Like government officials, voters have been turning cautiously optimistic, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows. By 39% to 23%, voters expect things to get better over the next year -- the highest level in a year."It's the second month in a row that there's been an uptick in the perception that things are getting better, and that's often a precursor of economic recovery," say pollsters Peter Hart and Vince Breglio, who conducted the survey. A new Chamber of Commerce survey of small and medium-sized firms finds sharply higher expectations for the economy but less confidence about their own enterprises."Business people are apprehensive that the good news they hear today may be the same false echo of recovery they heard last spring," says Chamber President Richard Lesher.NO DEAL?

New York City, which has spent most of the past decade in the rating-agency doghouse, received a big boost as a major credit-rating company upgraded nearly $28 billion of city debt.The upgrade to A3 from Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. was certainly good news for scores of investors who own city debt, either through mutual funds or by holding individual bonds. Both the current rating and the old one are "investment grade," but the one-notch upgrade could mean that more mutual funds and other institutional investors will buy city debt. Many institutions are restricted by their own rules in the amount of debt they can own in the B-rated category, where New York City had been.Moody's action, which applied to the city's general-obligation bond, was the first upgrade for such bonds since 1988, during former Mayor Edward Koch's administration and just before the city entered a deep recession. In fact, less than three years ago Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, the other big ratings house, downgraded city bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus.Market analysts said that city debt prices were largely unchanged by the news, but could improve in the days and weeks to come as more investors decide to buy New York debt again. Like Moody's, Standard & Poor's is seeing the city in a different light, and officials there said they are considering an upgrade of city bonds after New York releases its new budget.Can investors sleep tight knowing the rating agencies are keeping close tabs on the city's fiscal health? If you own city debt, you may want to study up on the last time bond raters said the city's finances were improving. In November 1987, Standard & Poor's upgraded city bonds just weeks after the stock market's crash; the market's tailspin caused massive layoffs on Wall Street, a citywide recession and, eventually, lower bond prices. Market participants said S&P didn't anticipate then how seriously New York City would be hurt by the crash.	['1']	['0']	[0.9935210347175598]

NEW YORK -- The economy continues to edge higher, and the consensus forecast is that the gains will continue, at least through 1988. The stock market, which moved upward last year mainly because of lower interest rates, now seems to be focusing mainly on an expectation of better corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987. What will the committee decide to do?It may not matter very much. Last February the FOMC decided that M1, the narrowly defined money supply, should grow at a rate between 3% and 8% in 1987. In July the committee reaffirmed that range but also said that growth in excess of 3% to 8% would be "acceptable." It's a good thing the committee left itself some leeway, since the actual growth rate was about 17%.But the committee, whose voting members are the Federal Reserve governors and five of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, is required by law to say something. Composing the statement will be a little more difficult than usual this time, since the Fed seems to have gotten itself into a box.Through last year the Federal Reserve was under pressure from the Reagan administration to force interest rates lower, depreciate the dollar and stimulate economic growth. Chairman Paul Volcker made occasional noises to the effect that a falling dollar could be inflationary, but by and large the Fed went along. After all, the consumer price index last year rose at an annual rate of 1.1%, so why worry about inflation?	['1']	['0']	[0.8237487077713013]

NEW YORK -- Most short-term interest rates climbed yesterday, adding to uncertainty about the Federal Reserve System's credit policy and sending a chill through the bond market.Even an unexpected decline of $300 million in the nation's money supply, reported by the Fed yesterday afternoon, did little to rejuvenate the credit markets. Bond prices slumped about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the third decline in a row, bringing the total drop to nearly two points.Many analysts are expecting huge increases in the money supply over the next few weeks, partly because of federal income-tax refunds and partly because they expect faster economic growth. Bond traders fear that rapid money growth would intensify investor fears about the inflation outlook and would make the Federal Reserve much less willing to ease credit conditions.Other Fed figures released yesterday contributed to confusion about Fed policy and the interest-rate outlook. "People were looking for clear evidence that the Fed had made a decisive move toward an easier policy, but the data didn't provide that," said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg & Co., a New Canaan, Conn.-based investment research firm. "The reserve data suggests that any move the Fed has made is a modest step indeed."The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, ranged between 8.125% and 8.25% most of yesterday. That was up from an average of 7.69% in the week ended Wednesday, which was the lowest weekly average since mid-1978. Bond traders monitor the funds rate closely because it strongly influences many other interest rates, including those that dealers themselves pay to finance their securities holdings.

WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department's new jobless figures pose a difficult problem for government policy makers.The numbers show the economy is expanding at a painfully sluggish rate, with only 40,000 new jobs created in June. Manufacturing employment fell by 30,000 during the month.But at the same time, the unemployment rate among civilians remained at historic lows, dropping to 5.2% in June from 5.3% in May. Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, believe joblessness can't drop any lower without sparking increased inflation.As a result, the new numbers aren't likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit. Fed officials wouldn't comment on the numbers for the record. But it was clear they saw little reason in the report to change their course and move toward lower short-term interest rates."This is the classical mixed bag," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.

Federal Reserve officials are debating whether to strengthen their commitment to keep short-term interest rates near zero as part of their effort to keep boosting the slow-growing economy.But they face many unresolved questions about whether to make such a move, and if so when, and several events in the coming days could shed light on their thinking.Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday in a hearing on her nomination to lead the Fed when Chairman Ben Bernanke's term ends in January. Mr. Bernanke speaks at the National Economic Club next Tuesday. And the Fed on Wednesday releases minutes of its October meeting, at which the idea likely was discussed.The Fed's vow to keep interest rates low for a long time is one of its key tools to rev up the economy, given that it has cut short-term rates nearly to zero. The commitment is one of two pillars of the Fed's easy-money policy, the other one being an $85 billion monthly bond-buying program. Officials might start scaling back the bond-buying program in the coming months, possibly as early as December, but want to reassure the public and investors they won't raise interest rates for a long time after they end the program.The Fed has said for months it won't raise short-term interest rates from near zero until the unemployment rate, which was 7.3% in October, falls below 6.5%, as long as inflation doesn't move above 2.5%. Fed officials believe the promise, known as "forward guidance," helps hold down long-term borrowing rates, which in turn encourages borrowing, investment and spending.

Auto dealers, department stores, home furnishers, building materials and garden centers, grocers, and gasoline stations were among the retailers that reported sales growth.Following the news last Friday that job growth rose sharply in April, the retail report provided more evidence that the economy rebounded last month after noticeably losing steam in March."Signs of a 'soft spot' are disappearing," said Kevin Cummins, an economist with UBS Securities LLC, referring to the weak retail sales and decline in hiring, factory production and consumer confidence in March.At the same time, however, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and others that cater to lower-income households continue to blame high energy costs, particularly gasoline prices, for their sluggish sales growth in recent months.

Author: Rhiannon HoyleThe price of gold is back at record levels. But whether it can hit $1,500 in the next few months could depend on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks with an ultraeasy monetary policy that is pushing down the dollar.Right now, the Fed appears divided over the outlook for its quantitative easing program, known to the market at QE2 and scheduled to end on June 30, and the possibility of higher interest rates later this year, even if U.S. unemployment remains high.Any fresh signs that the Fed remains concerned about the U.S. economy would boost gold, which is seen as an alternative currency and often attracts strong interest in times of economic uncertainty and unusually low or negative interest rates after adjusting for inflation, as is the case now. An even stronger signal for gold could come from an extension of the Fed's program beyond June, which for now, at least, seems likely.But any move by the Fed to exit quantitative easing or raise interest rates faster than analysts expect would be detrimental for gold prices, which has come to rely on the U.S.'s super-loose policy. Prices may also come under pressure as investors adjust to life after QE2 and react to any signs that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining traction.	['1']	['0']	[0.9847726821899414]

Brace yourself.Over the next several weeks, hundreds of U.S. companies will report profit-and-loss statements that are going to look ugly.According to analysts' estimates gathered by Thomson Financial/First Call, operating profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 declined 9% in the quarter ended March 31 from the year-earlier period. If the estimates hold up, it will be the sharpest drop since the 1990-91 recession. Second-quarter earnings are also expected to tumble 7% and the third-quarter outlook, while still barely positive, is rapidly deteriorating.That's a big departure from 1999 and 2000, when year-over-year quarterly operating profits frequently grew more than 20%. But some economists say the current decline doesn't begin to tell the full story of what's in store in the coming years.They say that even once the economy rebounds and earnings start growing again, the outsized profit gains of 1999 and 2000 are a thing of the past. Profits in the 1990s, they say, grew out of sync with the rest of the economy, lifted temporarily by tame debt and labor costs, accounting quirks and technology investments that might never yield significant returns. They say a reversion to the mean is in the works that will translate into a period of profit gains that, at best, are in the single digits. And if consumers cut back on spending in response to their stock market losses, it will only add to the profit pain.	['0']	['0']	[0.9900392889976501]

WASHINGTON -- Large gains in personal income and consumer spending in September indicate that the economy probably will continue to grow at a moderate rate in coming months.Personal income rose by a sturdy 0.9% during the month and consumer spending increased an even more robust 1.4%, the Commerce Department reported.That compares with income growth of 0.6% and flat consumption in August."These numbers should lay to rest for the time being any fears of recession," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc.The report, which follows two months of largely sluggish economic statistics, was good news for President Reagan, who has just 2 1/2 weeks left in his reelection campaign.But the department's report wasn't all roses. A consumption-based inflation measure, which is reported with a one-month lag, showed that prices paid by consumers were rising at a 0.6% rate in both July and August.

Sales of new homes surged in April as prices plummeted, indicating that builders are making huge concessions to entice buyers.The Census Bureau said sales of newly constructed homes rose 16.2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 981,000 homes, the largest monthly gain in 14 years and far exceeding economists' expectations. But the report also found that median prices tumbled 10.9% to $229,100 as builders offered deep discounts and other incentives."Aggressive sales techniques being employed by builders are now showing some success," David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement.That is an encouraging sign, say some economists, because it suggests that demand for housing can be revived if prices fall in line with buyers' expectations.

The bond market took a dive last week after several Federal Reserve policymakers were reported as hinting that the economy is growing so strongly that short-term interest rates ought to be raised soon.Senior analysts at several major Wall Street firms advised their traders that the uniformity of views in the reports was so striking that the statements undoubtedly were the result of a coordinated effort. Central bank officials were signaling financial markets that higher rates were on the way, the analysts said.There may be some flaws in that analysis: Several of the policymakers disavowed what they were reported to have said and they added that their statements were not coordinated.In interviews, several Fed officials said they expect economic growth to slow to a sustainable pace of around 2 percent in the second half of this year, with the risks about evenly balanced that growth will be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than that. That view hardly suggests a stampede to raise rates, particularly given the current inflation picture.The chart at the right shows how the Fed has slowed real economic growth to keep inflation low and also suggests that there is relatively little inflationary momentum that would require urgent Fed attention.

NEW YORK, Dec. 24 (AP) Wall Street received a surprise Christmas gift todays the biggest stock market rise in two weeks and another record high in the Associated Press average.The rise was a surprise because brokers anticipated considerable selling. This was the first day on which profits could be taken for entry into 1959 tax returns. A four-day market holiday begins Thursday since the Exchange will be closed Friday.

NEW YORK, May 25 The stock market was slugged for its biggest single-session loss in six and a half years today and prices retreated to levels not seen since the end of 1962.In a virtually non-stop onslaught of selling, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 20.81 points the biggest single-day loss of the current decline and within one point of the loss suffered after the assassination of President Kennedy on Nov. 23, 1963 and closed at 641.36. That was the lowest close since Dec. 18,1962, when the Dow finished at 640.14.The trend for the day became clear right after the opening bell. In the first 30 minutes the Dow fell more than 7 points.

Revenue rose 9.2% to $14.2 billion from $13 billion.Per-share earnings were up 12%, partly reflecting purchases by the company of 12 million of its shares during the quarter. GE had 878 million shares outstanding Sept. 30, compared with 906.4 million a year earlier. GE has bought back 35 million shares since its share-purchase program began in November.GE Chairman John F.

Those are known as GE's "shorter cycle" businesses, as contrasted to "longer cycle" lines such as aircraft engines, medical systems and power generation. The chairman also said the GE Appliance unit was able to compensate for the sales softness with productivity gains.Mr. Welch said that despite considerable uncertainty in the U.S. economy, GE "expects 1990 to be the fourth straight year of a double-digit increase in earnings per share."

Gas prices may be up and housing prices may be down, but the U.S. economy is still putting people to work and even adding a little padding to their paychecks.New data from the Labor Department show the jobless rate ticked down slightly in March, to 4.4 percent. Businesses and government created 180,000 new jobs -- far more than many economists had expected -- as good weather helped to fuel a rebound in construction hiring.Retailers, restaurants, schools and hospitals also added jobs at a brisk pace, according to the report, luring people back into the job market and more than offsetting job losses in factories, telecommunications and leasing. Meanwhile, average hourly wages for non-supervisory workers jumped to $17.22, up from $16.55 one year ago, a solid 4 percent increase."There's now very strong growth in the labor force, as strong as it's been since the turn of the decade," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. "Wages are rising and people are starting to recognize that this is the best time to be looking for a job since 2000."The drop in unemployment was the second consecutive monthly decline, pushing the jobless rate down to a level touched briefly last fall but not seen previously since 2001.

WASHINGTON -- The first quarter decline in productivity was much larger than originally reported, the Labor Department said.Revised figures show that nonfarm business productivity fell at an annual rate of 1.6% in the first quarter, rather than the 0.1% drop reported last month. Nonfarm productivity rose at a revised annual rate of 3.2% in the fourth quarter of last year.Productivity is defined as output per hour of work. The revisions reflect benchmark changes in both employment and production data.The department also said unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 5% in the first quarter, compared with a revised 0.6% increase in the fourth quarter.In another report yesterday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged in the week ended June 12 from a revised 344,000 the previous week.

The consumer leg of the economy, which has been remarkably stable throughout the housing downturn, may now be tottering.The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 246.79 points, or 1.9% to 12606.30 yesterday on the back of fresh signs that consumer spending is slowing. In an indication that even well-heeled shoppers may be cutting back, luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co. said that its U.S. sales slumped during the holiday period.

W. Lee Hoskins, chief economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh, estimated that each week of a strike at G.M. would reduce economic growth by about one-half percentage point. A strike that lasts well into the fourth quarter could easily halt economic growth or even cause a temporary decline, he said. Settlement Terms Stressed During the strike period, interest rates could fall, he said, but added that the lasting effect of the auto negotiations on interest rates will come from the terms of the settlement. A wage increase of 10 to 15 percent over three years could help reduce inflationary expectations, the economist said. But a raise of 20 to 25 percent could heighten fears of inflation and drive rates up, he said.	['1']	['0']	[0.9689382314682007]

The upswing in steel profits will derive from a number of factors, the most important of which is that steel consumption will be increasing at an above average rate. Domestic steel consumption, by our estimate, will rise between 5 percent and 6 percent, both this year and next, compared with a compound annual growth rate of 3.4 percent in the past decade. Another constructive factor is the new ceilings on imports, which means that the bulk of the consumption increase should accrue to domestic producers. This means that for the first time in the past decade the steel industryin 1972 and 1973 will be displaying two consecutive years of dynamically increased profits.	['1']	['1']	[0.8814347982406616]

Thanks to several years of fiscal restraint during the 1990s, the burden of federal spending dropped to 18.2% of gross domestic product by the time Bill Clinton left office. The federal budget today consumes more than 24% of economic output, a one-third increase since 2001 in the share of the U.S. economy allocated by politics rather than market forces. That makes the Republican House budget, which would reverse this trend, extremely important for the economic health of the country.Both political parties deserve blame for the spending spree that's put America in a fiscal ditch. President George W. Bush was a big spender and President Obama has compounded the damage with his stimulus spending and other programs.But the era of bipartisan big government may have come to an end. Largely thanks to Rep. Paul Ryan and the fiscal blueprint he prepared as chairman of the House Budget Committee earlier this year, the GOP has begun climbing back on the wagon of fiscal sobriety and has shown at least some willingness to restrain the growth of government.The Ryan budget has generated considerable controversy in Washington, and it will become even more of an issue now that Mr. Ryan is Mitt Romney's running mate. So it's an appropriate time to analyze the plan and consider what it would mean for America.The most important headline about the Ryan budget is that it limits the growth rate of federal spending, with outlays increasing by an average of 3.1% annually over the next 10 years. If spending is left on autopilot, by contrast, it would grow by 4.3% (or nearly 39% faster). If President Obama is re-elected, the burden of spending presumably will climb more rapidly.

The federal budget has served as a useful stabilizing force in the economy, partly through the exertion of automatic changes in tax receipts and transfer payments as incomes rise and fall, and partly through deliberate changes in tax and spending programs. The combination of automatic and discretionary budget forces has generated surpluses in prosperity and deficits in recession. The surpluses helped restrain booms and the deficits helped cushion the recession and aid recovery. But neither the size nor the timing of fiscal policy have been appropriate to the movement of the business cycle.	['1']	['0']	[0.9912897348403931]
30-year Treasury issues, a rise in yields of three-tenths of 1 percent over the coming year would leave you with total returns of slightly more than 3 percent.

The Federal Reserve, delivering the lowest short-term rates since John F. Kennedy was president, is pursuing its most aggressive campaign in recent history to stimulate the economy. But it's a campaign whose goal seems more elusive with each passing day.Yesterday, the Fed cut the target for its benchmark federal-funds interest rate to 2.5% from 3%, and left the door open to further rate cuts. "The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak," the Fed said in a statement explaining its action.Though the Fed's move was widely anticipated, investors reacted positively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 113.76 points, 1.29%, to 8950.59.Including its emergency rate cut just before the nation's stock markets reopened on Sept. 17, the Fed has chopped U.S. rates a full percentage point since Sept. 11, and by a whopping four percentage points since the start of the year.But lower interest rates work only if they induce consumers and businesses to borrow -- and then spend -- more. And since the Fed began cutting rates, the growth in business borrowing has ground to a halt, and consumer-credit growth has slowed sharply. Only home mortgage lending is still growing at a healthy pace, and even that has taken a hit in the wake of the terrorist attack.	['0']	['0']	[0.9316543936729431]

Others held that it was hard for interestrates to decline while there was strong demand by business for short-term credit.	['0']	['0']	[0.696792721748352]

NEW YORK -- The economy continued to grow in December, but at a slower pace, a monthly survey by purchasing agents indicated.The National Association of Purchasing Management said its members reported a decline in new orders, production and employment in December. For the 13th consecutive month, prices continued to fall."Traditionally the industrial economy slows in December, so what we are seeing isn't unusual," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee and purchasing director at Pitney Bowes Inc. "However, the fourth quarter and the year were a pleasant surprise. The continued low level of price increases also indicates inflation isn't on the horizon."The report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 industrial companies, indicates whether various indicators of the economy are better, the same, or worse than the previous month.The survey's composite index, on a seasonally adjusted basis, declined to 51.1% in December from 53.3% in November, the first drop in three months. But it was the fourth consecutive measure above 50%, a sign that the economy is expanding. A reading below 50% indicates the economy is in a declining phase.	['1']	['0']	[0.5530779361724854]
WASHINGTON -- Worker productivity in nonfarm businesses edged up at a 0.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said in revisions of an earlier report that said the figure was unchanged.Productivity, or output for each hour of work, climbed at an annual rate of 2% in the third quarter and dropped at a 2.4% rate in the second.The department estimated that productivity for all businesses, including farms, declined at a 2% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the same as originally reported. A drop in farm output stemming from last summer's drought was largely responsible.Growth in productivity is critical to the economy if it is to continue expanding without inflation.Unit labor costs increased at an annual rate of 5.6% in the fourth quarter, as the department initially calculated, after increasing at a 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter and a 6.8% annual rate in the second.

NEW YORK -- Interest rates are likely to push higher even when the long-awaited slowdown in the economy finally appears, according to many bankers and economists.The Federal Reserve System will keep a tight grip on credit in coming months to underscore its determination to hold the line on inflation, these analysts said. Furthermore, they said, businesses will borrow heavily to finance new equipment and the construction of new plants."We can't see a fundamental turn in interest rates without an abatement in the explosion" of business borrowing, said Wayne Lyski, a vice president of Alliance Capital Management Co., an investment manager. And that isn't likely, he contended. "The single biggest negative in the bond market continues to be an escalation in credit demands."Many investors have been hoping that slower economic growth will lead to less borrowing and lower interest rates. But those hopes are misplaced, argued Edward Yardeni, senior vice president and economist of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc."History shows that slower economic growth is associated with rising credit demands, not falling credit demands," Mr. Yardeni said. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds, currently at about 12 3/4%, are likely to surge to 14% by January, he predicted.	['0']	['1']	[0.9425610899925232]

The growing possibility of a sharp decline in world oil prices helped send the stock market skidding to its worst loss in three months yesterday and fueled a growing debate among economists about whether the United States would emerge a winner or once again a loser from a shift in the fortunes of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).A variety of economists interviewed yesterday said a gradual decline in the nominal price of oil on balance would be good for the country. But most thought a sharp drop in petroleum prices could cause serious problems for a number of important sectors of the American economy, including the oil, banking, coal, natural gas and synthetic fuels industries.In the long term, lower oil prices would mean greater economic growth for the American economy, said Eric Zausner, who heads the energy division of the consulting firm Booz-Allen & Hamilton. But in the short term, most of the effects would be negative.The irony is that when oilsoared to $34 per barrel, peo- ,* pie said how bad it was for ' the U.S. economy. And now that it may go back to $25, people are saying how bad it would be for the American economy. Well in both cases, they were right, because any ' sudden change causes short-, term economic dislocations.- benefiting at least modestly from a continued fall in the price of gasoline and home heating oil, which would leave them with money to spend on other things.My feeling is the sharp increase we had in energy prices really acted as a tax on American business and consumers, and a decrease would act as a tax deduction, said John C. Sawhill, a former federal energy administrator and now senior partner with the consulting firm of McKin-sey & Co. I believe it would be very stimulative to the economy.

Depending upon what figures we read, unemployment went up or it went down in the District of Columbia in January, according to a city government report. The jobless rate for city residents was 9.2 percent.The report revised some previous figures, and showed that the District, was worse off in December than the national average, rather than better off, as previously announced figures had indicated. The District also was worse off in January.To take it from the top: The D.C. Employment Services Department announced a month ago that the jobless rate for December was 8.6 percent. Yesterday it said that figure was wrong, that a statistical recalculation based on new national survey techniques showed the December rate really was 9.4 percent.Using that figure, January's 9.2 rate as adjusted was somewhow really lower than the 8.6 percent for the previous month.The new figures show that the District's 9.4 percent figure for December was higher than the national average rate of 8.8 percent and the 9.2 percent figure for January was higher than the U.S. average rate of 8.9 percent.

NEW YORK -- The bond market rallied strongly yesterday amid growing speculation that petroleum-producing nations may cut oil prices soon.Prices of some Treasury bonds surged more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates declined. Traders were "almost euphoric" as rumors of an impending oil-price reduction swirled through the credit markets, said Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners.Another cut in oil prices would give the Federal Reserve System additional latitude to ease credit conditions, paving the way for further declines in U.S. interest rates, according to many investment managers. They say an oil-price cut would enhance the prospects for continued low inflation.After surveying oil-company executives, Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an industry newsletter, concluded that oil prices "will remain weak or continue to slide" unless the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries takes "strong corrective action." A majority of executives surveyed said they expect a "virtually uninterrupted period of depressed demand" for oil over the next 18 months or more.Even without a reduction in oil prices, many analysts expect lower interest rates. They say that the economy is picking up only moderately from its sluggish first-quarter performance and that the Fed will ease its credit policy further in an effort to stimulate business activity.

For the past few years, investors could probably have made more money by picking up loose change from the sidewalk than by investing in a money-market mutual fund.Money funds are likely to regain appeal once interest rates rise again. Historically, when rates start moving upward, money-fund yields quickly follow, unlike those of bank savings accounts, which can lag.But for now, persistently low rates--coupled with uncertainty about a possible regulatory overhaul for money funds--are reasons to avoid using the funds for all but very-short-term parking of cash, financial advisers say.Money funds are mutual funds that invest in very-short-term debt issued by governments and large corporations, and that strive to maintain a set $1 share price. The average yield on taxable money funds for individual investors is just 0.01% a year, according to Crane Data LLC of Westborough, Mass. On an investment of $10,000, that is $1 a year.Such low yields are unlikely to climb soon, as many market professionals think there is still too much economic uncertainty for the Federal Reserve to start raising short-term rates. Moreover, the reason money funds have been able to offer any yield at all in recent years is that management companies have been waiving billions of dollars in fees.	['0']	['0']	[0.9678686857223511]

NEW YORK -- The stock market pulled out of a morning dive and closed higher, with rising bond prices, strong oil issues and program buying pulling blue-chip issues out of the depths.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 18.82 to 2917.33. Oil stocks led the rebound. Gains in Chevron, Exxon and Texaco accounted for about half of the average's overall advance.Rising oil prices hurt airline stocks, however. The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 9.67 to 1125.00. UAL's 6 1/8-point decline to 156 7/8 accounted for part of that move, but most other airline shares were lower because investors think higher fuel costs will erode their profits in the next several months. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 7/8 to 55 3/4.But a 17-cent rise in September crude oil futures to $20.21 a barrel had little effect on the Treasury bond market, which typically falls when oil prices gush. Bonds opened higher and kept climbing. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose nearly 7/8 of a point, or $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.Traders had trouble identifying the bond bulls.

Again following the lead of the bond market, the stock market yesterday finished moderately lower after failing to extend its late blue-chip rally from Monday. Trading continued at a relatively slow pace.Technology, oil and some of the chemical issues were among the casualties. Some of the housing stocks gained.After jumping 11.48 points on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average backtracked 4.63 points in yesterday's first half hour, but erased this loss in the next hour; falling again during the afternoon, the index was down 8.50 points at 3:30 p.m. EDT and then closed at 1126.88, off 7.17 points. The transportation indicator also fell, but the utility average posted a small rise.The downturn was less apparent in the broader market than in the industrial average. New York Stock Exchange losers led gainers by only about 7-to-6. A big part of the industrial average's setback was accounted for by Merck, which skidded 4 5/8 to 86 1/8 in active trading."The psychology of the market is dominated by interest rates, as illustrated by the sharp rally on Monday when bond prices rose and the lack of follow-through (yesterday) when the bond market faltered," commented Michael T. Murray, vice president of Loomis Sayles, Chicago.	['0']	['1']	[0.994366466999054]

Companies are acting as if they share this view.Even though it is five years since the tech bubble began deflating and three years after the brunt of uproar over corporate misbehavior bore down upon them, executives are still playing a conservative game. Despite brimming coffers and a generous financing environment, both spending on new equipment and hiring have lagged behind expectations.Today's Commerce Department report on durable-goods orders in May should give some indication of the pace of business spending.

WASHINGTON -- The nation's merchandise trade deficit widened slightly to $12.44 billion in January from $12.2 billion in December even though imports fell 6% to their lowest level in nine months.As they often do in January, exports also fell, dropping 10% from December. Exports remain far ahead of last year's levels, but some economists warned that the January figures suggest the export boom may be slowing."Slow (economic) growth abroad could make it difficult to maintain the kind of export growth we've seen in the past few months," said Jerry Jasinowski, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.The trade report, which was better than many economists expected, sparked rallies in the dollar and in the stock and bond markets.Continued export growth is important if the U.S. is to shrink its trade deficit and avoid an economic slowdown. Exports of manufactured goods, which account for two thirds of all U.S. exports of goods, dropped 7.6% as exports of machinery, chemicals and aircraft fell.	['0']	['0']	[0.9845781922340393]
The global economy faces a collapse not equaled since the Great Depression of the 1930s if the major nations fail to take quick and drastic steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit and equivalent surpluses in Europe and Asia, 33 leading economic experts warned yesterday.That danger, they said, was signaled by the stock market collapse around the world in October and by an earlier plunge of the U.S. bond market.The economists' conclusions were contained in a report issued here by the Institute for International Economics and simultaneously published by eight other international research centers.The economists said Americans would have to accept a sharp cutback in personal consumption in the years ahead so that more U.S.-made goods could be shipped abroad to reduce the trade deficit.As this somber forecast was issued, the Reagan administration was nearing completion of its official estimates for economic growth next year, lowering its prediction by about 1 percentage point to reflect the impact of the October stock market collapse.

WASHINGTON -- An unexpected surge in tax receipts in April may help cut the federal budget deficit this year, according to administration and congressional officials.The receipts soared to about $120 billion from $91.44 billion a year earlier. While a large rise was expected because of tax-law changes and economic growth, the increase appears to be $5 billion to $10 billion bigger than anticipated."The Treasury is sitting on a humongous pile of cash," said Peter Davis, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "Nobody had any idea of how massive it would be." Mr. Davis said he has narrowed his deficit estimate for fiscal 1987, which ends Sept. 30, to about $185 billion from as much as $200 billion.Treasury and congressional analysts caution that it's too soon to tell whether the surge will mean a smaller deficit for the year; the high April payments could be offset by low receipts later. Moreover, slower economic growth, higher interest rates and increased federal outlays all could swell the deficit.Reagan administration budget officials previously have said they expect a fiscal 1987 deficit in the range of $175 billion to $180 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimate is $174 billion. In fiscal 1986, the deficit totaled $220.7 billion.	['1']	['1']	[0.9952488541603088]

With unemployment at 9.6% and inflation below the Federal Reserve's working definition of "price stability," this seems a strange moment for Congress to contemplate instructing the Fed to focus exclusively on fighting inflation.But Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) wants to revive that notion, which has lain dormant for more than a decade because there has been so little inflation. "I am concerned about inflation down the road," he explains. "The time is right for us to bring clarity to the Fed." In the House, Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Michael Pence (R., Ind.) agree. Mr. Pence argues that the Fed's quest to combat unemployment by buying $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys is a failure and threatens to "monetize our debt and trigger inflation."The implication is that the Fed has lost its moorings. Has it really? For more than 30 years, Congress has charged the Fed with aiming at "maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates." That wording has long made some Fed officials and academic economists uneasy because it is rooted in a now-abandoned view that the government could dial up a little more inflation to get a little less unemployment and vice versa.The current consensus is that the Fed can -- and, indeed, is now attempting to -- reduce unemployment in a recession, but in the long run can deliver only price stability. What Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke calls "the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate" is determined by demographics, job-market rules and other factors beyond the Fed's control. In this view, if the Fed tried to push unemployment too low now, it could create too much inflation later, the mistake the Fed made in the late 1970s.But it is not the 1970s. Even though the Fed has been holding short-term interest rates near zero for nearly two years, prices rose at only a 1% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. No measure of inflation expectations foresees anything like the 8%-plus inflation of the '70s. And it's hard to find a single Greenspan or Bernanke decision that would have been different if they had an inflation-only mandate. So why all this now?	['0']	['0']	[0.6284343600273132]

The prime rate went up by half a percentage point, to 9 percent. After weeks of increases in other rates, the move by banks to raise their base lending rate was no surprise. Nevertheless, the financial markets took it as confirmation of a discouraging trend. At 9 percent, the prime is where it was before the stock market crash of October. The prime influences the borrowing costs of small and medium-size businesses and consumers. The Federal Reserve influences the borrowing costs of thebanks, and there were signs of a squeeze. The highly sensitive Federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks edged up to 7 percent, from slightly below 7 percent.	['0']	['0']	[0.9917830228805542]
For the country as a whole, household savings have long been greater than debts, even including home mortgages, and households have traditionally earned more interest than they pay. Since the late 1970's, when controls on interest rates were removed from bank deposits, the gap between interest receipts and interest payments has widened. By the first quarter of this year, households earned $680 billion of interest but paid only $320 billion.	['0']	['0']	[0.9869492650032043]

PROPONENTS of a higher minimum wage, frustrated by federal inaction, are turning their attention to the state level, and their efforts to tap voters' angst over the quality of new jobs could affect the presidential race.In November, voters in two key battlegrounds, Nevada and Florida, will be asked to raise the minimum wage in their states. Those on both sides of the initiatives believe the measures could increase voter turnout among Democratic-leaning African-Americans, Hispanics and low- income workers -- and possibly boost Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry's showing against President Bush.The initiative drives have no formal connection to Mr. Kerry or the Democrats, and they come after 12 other states and Washington, D.C., already have established minimum wages higher than the federal rate. That figure, now $5.15 an hour, was last raised by Congress in 1997.Democrats and their allies hope the measures can help mobilize core backers upset about the economy in the same way Republicans pick up support from initiatives important to their supporters. Polls suggest Democrats hold the high ground on economics this year, and pushing for a higher minimum wage provides an opportunity to spotlight their policies. Similarly, allies of the president have been pressing state initiatives to bar gay marriage in several electoral battlegrounds.This year, polls show, weak job growth, the low pay of many newly created jobs and a widening gap between rich and poor are weighing on voters' minds. While many economists believe a higher minimum wage deters employment of low-skilled workers, the issue has wide political appeal, and even many business-friendly Republicans are loath to openly oppose an increase.
