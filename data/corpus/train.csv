1,"[Home values keep climbing across the U.S. But we looked at 500 neighborhoods -- and found slowdowns in some surprising spots. June Fletcher tours the towns to watch.]THEY'RE UP 16% in a Washington, D.C., suburb, but losing steam in Denver. And just outside Los Angeles, home prices in the hillside town of La Canada Flintridge have shot up more than 23% from a year earlier. ""We've been discovered,"" says Michael Braverman, who expects to get $500,000 more for his home than he paid five years ago.Forget watching the stock market. The best -- and maybe the only -- game in town these days is the remarkably resilient real-estate market. Last year alone, amid all the bad news, home prices still rose by 7% nationally -- and some economists believe things will be almost as strong this year. And yet, many homeowners are holding their breath, worrying about the ""bubble"" and asking: What about my town?We've got some answers. In an exhaustive town-by-town survey, we looked at home prices in more than 500 upscale ZIP Codes, taking a snapshot of prices last year and comparing them with the year before. We found that nobody in Greenwich, Conn., or Southern California is losing sleep. But who'd have thought duplex-lined Beach Haven, N.J., would be in the top 10 nationally for growth -- or that so many other overlooked communities would be so strong (introducing . . . Mattapoisett, Mass.). In last place? No, it's not Silicon Valley.But our biggest surprise, given all the news, was just how many hot markets seem to be cooling off. Indeed, according to our survey by housing specialists Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss, the growth rate of prices in fully a third of our towns has slowed from the same time frame a year earlier. ""There's just air coming out of the market,"" says David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, who expects price growth to slow nationally to about 4% this year."

1,"Only three times in the last two years has the 30-year Treasury bond moved into the 7.8 percent to 8 percent interest rate ""zone."" Usually, the bond encounters strong market resistance in moving below 8 percent.Why has it been difficult for the long bond to move down through 8 percent, and what will it take for long rates to fall to the low levels of 1987? The answers hinge on inflation and the recovery.We have to go back to the first quarter of 1987 to find yields at those low levels, prior to the three recent instances. At that time, the bond traded at 7.27 percent to 7.88 percent, with the lower yields occurring in January 1987. Then, as the economy began to improve and inflation began to rise, rates rose until Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points.Inflation is the first part of the answer. The consumer price index, a widely followed measure of inflation, rose a mere 1.1 percent from December 1985 to December 1986, helped by a 30.7 percent decline in energy costs. The CPI was up only 3.8 percent the previous year.As a result of two good inflation years back to back, interest rates began to trend lower in February 1986, touching briefly at 7.16 percent in July, and then ambulating between 7.16 percent and 7.77 percent before closing the year at 7.33 percent. They plateaued in the first quarter of 1987."
0,"For months, pessimistic bond markets and optimistic central bankers have been in a tug of war over where the world economy is headed. A renewed plunge in long-term interest rates world-wide suggests the pessimists are winning.Government bond yields in the U.S., the euro zone and Asia have all fallen sharply in recent weeks, fed by a diet of disappointing economic data, lackluster business investment and -- in a new development yesterday -- hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon take a break from raising interest rates.The decline in long-term interest rates mystifies central bankers -- even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. They see creeping inflation risks and a still-robust outlook for the global economy outside of Europe. And they're increasingly concerned that low long-term rates are also fueling an unsustainable surge in housing prices.Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds jumped yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, tumbled to 3.89%, from 4% Tuesday. That's the lowest since March last year, before the first of the Fed's eight quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increases. The drop came after Richard Fisher, new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that the Fed is in the ""eighth inning"" of raising rates, suggesting he believed an increase by the Fed later this month might be its last. Investors expect the Fed to boost its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.25% from 3% at its meeting on June 29 to June 30.Mr. Fisher's comments are at odds with those of other Fed officials who have emphasized that interest rates are still too low to ensure low inflation. But his remarks reinforced a view of many bond traders and a few economists that economic growth in the U.S. is slowing and inflation is ebbing, both of which will lead the Fed to take a pause from raising rates."
0,"Worries about a drawn-out recession and the prospect of deflation gave Treasurys a boost, with the 30-year bond rocketing higher.Minutes from the Federal Reserve, which suggested further interest-rate cuts, added to the government-bond market's gains, as did the sharp falls in stocks. The Fed also downgraded both its growth and employment forecasts, signaling that weakness in the economy will persist into 2009. As investors sought safety in Treasurys, bond yields, which move inversely to prices, fell across the board.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note saw its yield fall to 3.390%, from 3.537% Tuesday, as the price rose 1 8/32 points, or $12.50 for every $1,000 invested, to 103 1/32. The 30-year bond surged 3 5/32 points, or $31.5625 for every $1,000 invested, to 109 4/32, to yield 3.972%, from 4.147% Tuesday. The two-year yield fell to 1.110%, the lowest since June 13, 2003.Worries about deflation sent the 10-year break-even rate, the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities and 10-year nominal Treasurys, to a low of 0.37 percentage point, the lowest level since the Treasury Department started to sell TIPS in 1997.The gap suggests investors expect an average annualized inflation of 0.37% over the next decade, adding to the shift over the past few months from inflation concerns to deflation worries."

But it could backfire and fuel fears that the Fed, by using its power to print money to help the government finance soaring budget deficits, is kindling inflation. Those fears could, paradoxically, send Treasury yields higher.The market's initial reaction was mostly positive. Treasury yields dropped sharply, as previous research conducted by Mr. Bernanke suggested would happen. The Bank of England's decision earlier this month to begin purchasing government debt provided comfort that the move would work. Yields on British gilts have declined by roughly half a percentage point after it decided to buy gilts.An explosion of federal borrowing had started to put upward pressure on Treasury yields, said Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. ""Fed purchases could relieve some of that pressure and have a meaningful impact on yields.""But in a hint of potential worries among investors about the Fed flooding the economy with even more money, the dollar dropped against the euro and the yen. The euro landed at $1.34 in late trading, up from $1.30 the day before, the biggest one-day gain since its birth in 1999."

0,"DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers, in a mood of caution, are planning to build fewer cars in this year's fourth quarter than in any last quarter since the recession-plagued final period of 1982.While a shift toward van and light-truck production accounts for some of the drop in car assembly, the factory schedules nonetheless indicate that the economy's ""soft landing"" hasn't yet erased fears of a slump in Detroit. ""The other side of a soft landing is a soft recovery,"" said Mary Ann Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. ""We haven't created the pent-up demand,"" necessary for a sales boom, she added.The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production. Plants owned by foreign auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S. companies plan to build 312,609 cars in the fourth quarter, or 18.3% of the total, up from 205,875 cars, or 10.9% of the total a year ago.Overbuilding earlier in the year caused auto makers to trim their bulging inventories of vehicles by sponsoring aggressive sales promotions, including cash rebates to consumers. That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years."

Increasingly a system in which money is invested in the future of money.The most revealing aspect of last week's currency chaos is the entirely reasonable assumption by the media that nobody understood it.

But last week's crisis suggests that, just as few people in the country seems to know much history, science or culture, the mechanisms of modern capitalism are widely misunderstood and that this is a field much dependent on faith: You put money in the bank, and after that, all is currency transubstantiation.And why not?

1,"Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally ""The Road to War"" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. ""Why should I nationalize the industry?"" he once said. ""I shall nationalize the people"" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that ""the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939."" (""Clearly""? And did Hitler plan for ""a prolonged conflict""?) But on page 409, he states that ""the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered."" Another contradiction: ""Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end."" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence."

After opening the year in a pessimistic mood, investors turned joyous as the Dow Jones Industrial Average charged through the 4000 and 5000 milestones before the end of the year.By year end, most every investor had reason to smile. The Dow, up 33.45%, edged out most of the mutual funds, but even those laggards had a good year. And all these gains came with little queasiness. According to Ned Davis Research Inc., Nokomis, Fla., the Dow's biggest correction in 1995 was a record low 3.3%. In addition, Ned Davis Research says the Dow, which hit its last bear market bottom in October 1990, has put in its longest run ever without a 10% correction.But the spectacular year required something akin to a razor's edge dance by the economy. The enriching combination of modest growth with good profits -- the so-called soft landing -- came about despite a great deal of cynicism that it could ever happen.Can that perfect combination continue? Most analysts now say yes. Sort of. Few expect another raucous year with gains of more than 30%. Instead, the bull market will have a return to normalcy, with consensus expectations hovering around a 10% return for the year.Of course, it must be noted early on that many chin-scratchers erred badly in their 1995 outlooks a year ago. The consensus expected some sort of correction in the stock market, with prices moving higher later in the year. But hardly anyone thought the Dow would cruise past 5000."

Among the prolific Victorians, the only one with an ample number of works readily available is Dickens.

The rebound squelched budding fears that Wednesday's sell-off might herald the beginning of a more serious correction.But some analysts warned that long-term interest rates are getting dangerously high. As the prices of long-term Treasury bonds have eroded during the past month the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30year bond has risen to 7.78% from 7.39%. A yield of 7.8%, some analysts suggest, may be enough to divert investors away from stocks' uncertain prospects of eventually fatter corporate profits and direct them back to bonds as a competitive investment.Bond prices slipped yesterday amid confusion about the Treasury's intentions for financing the federal debt. Yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman told a congressional committee that the administration's budget proposal assumes that the Treasury will place less emphasis on the 30-year bond as a financing instrument than in the past.

Without Fed action, many investors doubt a U.S. economic rebound will start soon or be very robust.At the same time, the Fed's reluctance to lower short-term rates while interest rates abroad are falling makes the returns available in the U.S. more attractive to foreign investors, thus contributing to the strength of the U.S. currency."

1,"In reviewing the U.S. Treasury bond market in 1991, one cannot help but be impressed by the steep decline in interest rates and by the volume of actual financing.We are all aware of the weakness that permeated the economy and how the Federal Reserve responded to that weakness during the year. Initially, an economic rebound was anticipated, but when one failed to develop, the Fed responded with dramatic cuts in short-term administered rates the discount rate and the federal funds rate which the Fed directly controls.As a result of these cuts, two-thirds or more of the decline in the short rates occurred in the second half of the year, with most of that decline occurring in November and December. Consequently, the yield curve, as measured from either short rates or from the two-year note out to the 30-year bond, widened to record levels. For example, the Treasury yield curve (two-year note to the 30-year bond) began the year at a spread of -1-102 basis points and closed at +266 basis points. At midyear, the curve was only +146 and by December had widened to a high of +276 basis points.However, since the deficit continues to grow, the overall interest cost of the debt continued to rise. To be more correct on this point, if interest rates had not declined so much, and the curve had not taken on such a positive shape, the interest cost for financing the debt would have been probably as much as one-third higher.Another feature of last year's market was its ability to finance such a huge amount of debt at such modest interest rates. True, the anemic economy and the Fed helped a great deal, but when one considers the volume of financing, it is quite incredible."

0,"Author: Sudeep ReddyWASHINGTON--Federal Reserve officials acknowledged a housing-market bubble more than a year before U.S. house prices peaked, but they showed little inclination to address it, according to transcripts of their 2005 meetings released Friday.During 2005, the Fed raised interest rates a quarter-percentage point at every meeting, unwinding the ultra-loose policy it pursued earlier in the decade to address deflation worries after the 2001 recession. The economy at the time was growing at a healthy pace with few signs of overheating. But with reports across the U.S. indicating a bubble in the housing market, the Federal Open Market Committee spent time assessing the appreciation in home prices and what, if anything, the Fed could do about it. Fed staff economists had found that housing might be overvalued by as much as 20%, based on the historical relationship between prices and rents.But Fed officials appeared hamstrung because they believed their most important tool--interest rates--could not address frothy housing markets alone without influencing the broader economy.""I get very irritated when I see columns suggesting that we are trying to inspire or should be trying to prick a housing bubble,"" said Fed Governor Edward Gramlich, who died in 2007.

The target on the federal-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, was chopped to a 45-year-low of 1% in mid-2003 from 6.5% at the start of 200. With much advance warning, the Fed began lifting rates in June.The economy now appears to have pulled out of a ""soft patch"" -- as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has put it -- that was largely the result of higher oil prices.

The area's unemployment rate was 3 percent in March, the lowest of any major city and down from 3.2 percent in February and 3.7 percent in March 2003.With both the government and private sectors now expanding at a healthy pace, some forecasters expect the Washington area to generate 80,000 jobs in 2004, on par with the boom years in the late 1990s.""The recovery has strengthened and broadened,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wachovia Corp. who is one such forecaster.

0,"WASHINGTON--The breakdown in deficit-reduction talks between the White House and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R., Ohio) could immediately increase the risk that Standard & Poor's takes the unprecedented step of lowering its top-notch rating of U.S. government debt.The credit-rating firm has warned repeatedly that it could move to downgrade U.S. debt if it believes any deficit-reduction deal isn't robust enough to change the country's trajectory of future debt growth. A downgrade could come even if officials agree to raise the federal debt ceiling by Aug. 2. Treasury Department officials have set that as the deadline because after that date, without more borrowing authority, the government could run out of cash to pay all its bills.Messrs. Obama and Boehner had been trying to package a deal that would reduce future federal deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a level S&P officials had suggested would be sufficient to avoid a downgrade. A lower credit rating would raise borrowing costs not just for the government, but also for consumers and businesses, which could slow U.S. economic growth. It also could lower the value of Treasury securities held as assets by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other investors around the world, potentially shaking financial markets.Now that the large-scale talks have broken down, policy makers will likely pursue a smaller-scale deal that falls short of S&P's targets. Mr. Obama alluded to this possibility Friday evening.""If we can't come up with a serious plan for actual deficit and debt reduction, and all we're doing is extending the debt ceiling for another six, seven, eight months, then the probabilities of downgrading U.S. credit are increased, and that will be an additional cloud over the economy and make it more difficult for us and more difficult for businesses to create jobs that the American people so desperately need,"" Mr. Obama said Friday evening."

The Philadelphia Fed also uncovered evidence that factory wages are rising as a result of worker shortages.And a separate Fed report said the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.9% of capacity in May, higher than at any time since March 1980. Economists say that the closer business gets to operating at full capacity, the greater the risks of a spurt in inflation.Separately, the Commerce Department said business inventories grew 0.5% in April, largely reflecting a jump in wholesalers' inventories. Sales by manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers dropped 0.2%. As a result, the ratio of inventories-to-sales increased slightly to 1.51 in April from 1.50 in March, remaining within the range in which the ratio has traveled for the past year.As the factory problems noted by the Fed may be interpreted by some as a sign of an overheating economy and more inflation, they could lead the central bank to boost interest rates in the coming months.

Building permits, a key measure of future construction activity, fell by 7.5%.

1,"For a quarter-century, a Boston inventor has been obsessed with a single idea: an innovation that would give millions of American workers the chance to borrow their own money from their 401(k) savings plans using a new kind of credit card.In 1980 the inventor, an animated fellow named Francis Vitagliano, shared his concept with an MIT professor, Franco Modigliani. The Italian-born economist had been writing for 20 years about his theory of how and when people spend and save money during their lifetime, the so-called Life-Cycle Hypothesis. Modigliani's work would win him the 1985 Nobel Prize in Economics, but the call from Vitagliano would, he thought, give him a way to test his theory in real life.The men became champions for this new financial instrument, spending untold sums for a patent on the card idea, trying to sell it to banks and credit card companies, and withstanding a barrage of criticism from members of Congress and the financial community.Franco Modigliani died last year at age 85. But tomorrow in Washington, Francis Vitagliano, now 55, is scheduled to watch as the 401(k) card is unveiled at a financial conference.

Whatever the immediate outcome, this is not the last stop for the controversial card as it does or does not become a staple of American getting and spending. And the tale of how it came to exist is one worth telling."
1,"NEW YORK -- What goes on here?Talk persists that a recession is brewing, very possibly arriving within the year. Yet, at the same time, signs mount that the economy is reasonably robust, with brisk gains in employment, capital spending and exports leading the way to new highs in overall business activity.The juxtaposition may seem peculiar, to say the least, but there's really nothing very odd about it. Recessions normally do arrive on the heels of relatively robust economic activity, not when business is stagnating. This is because, in a sustained upswing, a burgeoning economy eventually comes up against barriers -- financial as well as physical -- to further growth. A recession perforce ensues.How close to such a barrier point is the economy now?Closer, perhaps, than is widely recognized."

0,"NEW YORK -- A weaker dollar and worries about several economic reports to be released today depressed Treasury, municipal and mortgage-backed bonds.Fears of higher interest rates abroad contributed to the setback. Actively traded Treasury issues fell about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Much larger declines -- although for different reasons -- were posted by corporate junk bonds, which recently have fallen into a deep slump.Junk bonds, those issued by companies with low credit ratings or no ratings at all, tumbled yesterday by as much as two points. One major reason: worries that slower economic growth will mean trouble for many companies burdened by heavy debts. Traders also worry that an avalanche of new junk-bond issues over the next few months could weigh heavily on the market.Nervousness about today's economic reports has pervaded the financial markets all week. Bond traders are especially concerned about the producer price and trade reports.The PPI report is commanding special attention partly because the two previous reports showed much larger increases than most analysts had expected. Those reports showed a huge 1% surge in prices in both January and February, heightening inflation fears. This time around, many forecasters expect the March report to show an increase of 0.5%."

The flood of credit to which Mr. Bush was referring fueled a boom on Wall Street, providing loans for homeowners, including some with poor finances, and sparking a wave of corporate takeovers financed with debt.

And revised figures released yesterday show that the economy contracted by 1.6% in the third quarter of 1990, instead of growing 0.2%.

0,"WASHINGTON -- Retail sales tumbled in March as job losses and tight credit left consumers cautious and constrained, damping hopes for a rapid economic turnaround.After some improvement earlier this year from a dismal autumn, retail sales in March fell 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Credit turmoil continued to hit automobile sales especially hard, but the declines also came in most major categories, from appliances to furniture to clothing stores. Retail sales, a broad tally that also includes food services, were down more than 9% from the same month a year ago.The decline signaled that consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity, probably won't bounce back quickly from the depths of the recession. Consumers, hit by a weak job market and steep declines in household wealth, remain worried that more tough times lie ahead.The retail-sales report comes after weeks of hope that the recession was nearing its low point. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a speech Tuesday at Morehouse College in Atlanta, cited recent data on home sales, home building and consumer spending, including sales of new vehicles, as ""tentative signs that the sharp decline in economic activity may be slowing."" But the central-bank chief warned that ""we will not have a sustainable recovery without a stabilization of our financial system and credit markets.""The economy continues to deteriorate at a rapid pace. Unemployment is rising, and consumers who have seen their wealth vanish are expected to keep socking away cash to replenish their savings."
0,"On Friday the Labor Department released employment data for June. The employment report is the most important monthly statistical release the government produces and the focus is always on the unemployment rate and the monthly change in payroll employment. The June report showed a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5% and a relatively small fall in payroll employment of 114,000 jobs.The market took those statistics badly. The stock market sold off, as did the long Treasury bond. Stocks were looking for more cost-cutting measures from companies, in this case a bigger drop in payroll employment. Bonds were looking for a stronger signal that the economy was weak and that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates.But there is a little secret in the employment report that you should know about. The Labor Department said that payroll employment fell 114,000 in June. What it did not tell you is that this reported change includes a ""bias adjustment factor"" that adds about 160,000 jobs a month. This bias factor is basically picked out of thin air, and is supposed to capture employment in newly started firms that Labor misses in its survey. In other words, Labor doesn't know how many new hires occurred at new companies, so it assume a number. In its June report, it continued to guess that it missed 155,000 new hires.The problem is that when the economy slumps, so do new business start-ups. A good indicator of new business starts is the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising. This index has plummeted back to levels last seen at the end of the 1990 recession. Back then, the bias factor also fell to zero, instead of hanging at the same level as in the boom period of 1998.Compare the published payroll survey with another measure of employment, the Labor Department's household survey, which measures employment by asking a survey of people, not businesses, if they have lost their job. The household survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate, but is otherwise ignored because it is very volatile from month to month. Over the past five months this survey shows a fall in employment of more than one million. Over the same five months the published payroll survey has fallen only 45,000. However, if you remove the monthly addition of 155,000 from the bias factor, payroll employment would be down 269,000 in June and 872,000 over the past five months. Now we're talking big numbers."

Overall, exports increased 9.8% to $74.67 billion in the latest quarter from $68.01 billion in the previous period.U.S. exports have benefited from the dollar's decline in foreign currency trading over the past three years.

It compared with 8.31 million yesterday and was the largest since June 29 when 10.49 million shares were traded.That day, said analysts, constituted a 'selling complex to the monotonous market decline which had been in effect since mid-May when the averages reached historic highs.The biggest dav in market history was Black Tuesday,'Oct. 29, 1929, when 16.4 million shares changed hands.

Mom is partial to chicken soup, Uncle Pete prefers a shot of Jack Daniels and over at the National Association of Manufacturers they like to prescribe a weak U.S. dollar.With the U.S. trade deficit still large, the weak-dollar boys are back selling their elixir to Congress. Our old friend Jerry Jasinowski, head of NAM, was his typically laid-back self this week, explaining that an ""overvalued"" dollar ""is decimating U.S. manufactured-good exports, artificially stimulating imports and putting hundreds of thousands of American workers out of work."" How it managed to cause all of this mayhem while the economy was growing by some 5.8% in the first quarter must constitute a miracle. Either that, or maybe a strong greenback isn't quite the economic disaster he claims.The U.S. had a robust currency all throughout the 1990s when times were flush. The same was true for most of the 1980s, though we recall similar moaning about the Reagan dollar. The worst recent decade for U.S. economic policy was the 1970s, when the Nixon and Carter Treasuries decided to take NAM's advice and debase the dollar. Nirvana did not arrive.NAM's argument isn't economic policy so much as special pleading. Its members have to cope with rugged foreign competition, and they're looking for some government relief. They figure that the inefficient steelmakers got theirs -- tariffs -- so it's only fair that they now get a similar break. A dollar devaluation would be a kind of universal tariff on imports.You'd think Mr. Jasinowski would worry about the company he's keeping here. His allies include the AFL-CIO, that free-market paragon, and in the Senate the likes of Maryland's Paul Sarbanes, who has never met a tax or regulation he didn't like. He's only too happy to flack for NAM when it gives him a chance to whack foreign imports."

For police officers and firefighters who have retired since 2007, the average pension is $95,336, making them among the most generously compensated in the state.Since the recession, dozens of state legislatures and city councils across the U.S. have scaled back benefits and jobs in an attempt to plug gaping budget holes.

Low Fed targets have helped keep most market interest rates down, helping stocks and bonds for more than 18 months.Many expect the Fed today will end its promise to be ""patient"" about raising rates.

The decline marks a significant reversal in borrowing, which peaked at $122.1 billion in 2010-11 after rising for years.The drop is partly due to a decline in enrollment at for-profit colleges, where most students borrow and where default rates are generally higher. The schools have come under increased scrutiny since 2010, when a report by the Government Accountability Office found deceptive practices that ranged from promising unrealistically high pay for graduating students to not disclosing total tuition costs for students before they enrolled.At traditional colleges, families have been cutting back on expenses, experts say. A growing share of students are commuting from home rather than living on campus, for example, according to a report issued earlier this year by SLM Corp., the largest private student lender, also known as Sallie Mae.An improving economy and stock market are also likely contributing to families borrowing less, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president at Edvisors.com, a Las Vegas-based firm that tracks financial aid and student loans.

How Mr. Bush handles it between now and November 2004 is likely to determine whether he wins re-election or is voted out after one term, as his father was. Just hours after watching Iraqis clamber on a fallen statue of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush brainstormed yesterday with Chief of Staff Andrew Card and legislative liaison David Hobbs to figure out a way to salvage his $725 billion tax-cut package, under siege on Capitol Hill.""He's in the catbird seat,"" says Princeton University's Fred Greenstein, a presidential historian.

They include the prospect of continued sporadic fighting and casualties, and the complicated task of overseeing humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Iraq. The White House's insistence on taking the lead in rebuilding Iraq could undermine the very government they help create and further alienate European allies, whose financial assistance will be critical to a process some estimate could cost an annual $25 billion for many years to come.

1,"Author: Dave KansasThe stock market has had a heady few weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has mustered above 11000 for the first time since April -- and it has managed to stay there through the early part of the third-quarter earnings season.But the swift rise of the market -- the Dow is up about 10% from its Aug. 31 close -- comes against a backdrop of somewhat unsettling news. The jobless rate remains stuck just below 10% with little respite in sight. The housing market is still very weak, and is enduring further shocks as lenders' foreclosure problems keep getting worse. The political situation seems a bit chaotic. And the global recovery is uneven enough that the Federal Reserve is thinking of yet more extraordinary measures to get things rolling.Even with those headwinds, the mood among stock investors as we near the end of October is surprisingly upbeat. Third-quarter earnings are coming in better than expected and optimism about the Fed's latest extraordinary plan -- quantitative easing part two, or QE2 -- is rampant in the stock market. We entered the dreaded September-October period in fear; we are leaving it with bliss breaking out.Such sudden shifts in sentiment, especially with uncertainty on the rise, makes me a little queasy. Given the widespread gains, it might make sense to examine your portfolio now with an eye toward rebalancing, rather than wait for the end of the year. In so doing, you may want to pare back some of the bigger winners and salt away the gains for the coming year."

Many traders who fueled the record 86-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday were relying on a report last week showing that civilian unemployment in August declined from 6.9 to 6.8 percent, economists said.However, economists said that a small drop in unemployment for one month does not make a trend and that other statistics suggest continued stagnation.The Labor Department yesterday reported that the increase in the producer price index followed a 0.4 percent decline in July and no change in June.In a separate report, the Commerce Department reported that the retail sales increase was the largest since a 0.9 percent rise in April.

Exports fell in January to $35.54 billion from a revised $35.89 billion in December, while imports dropped to $41.3 billion from a revised $41.89 billion.Although exports declined slightly, they continue to be a source of frustration for U.S. manufacturers.

It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns."

The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly.As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process.Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 (between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures) and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy ""heats up."" * The Fed: Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued ""price stability"" and has raised interest rates (as in 1994) to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.* Better Management: Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons: the recession; foreign competition; deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries; ""hostile"" corporate takeovers; the growth of new discounters (Wal-Mart, Home Depot). Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and ""downsizings"" became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and (as with Volcker's recession) widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.* New Technology: As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise ""productivity."" Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s."

1,"Finally, there is some good news about the U.S. economy.After weeks of troubling reports that suggested the U.S. economy stalled at the end of the summer, the Labor Department said nonfarm business productivity grew at an impressive 4% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter. That was more than double the 1.7% rate of the previous quarter, and a good indication that the underlying potential of the economy remains strong.In the 12 months through September, nonfarm productivity grew 5.3%, its fastest rate in 19 years. Economists have attributed the gains to increased efficiencies from computers and the Internet, as well as the fact that employees that remain after a wave of layoffs tend to be more skilled. Although labor costs are rising, output is rising more than enough to compensate.Such strong productivity doesn't necessarily change the short-term economic outlook, which remains somewhat gloomy. But it does suggest that corporate profits will continue to improve and that inflation will remain in check -- both of which are important if the economy is to get back on track.When a company boosts productivity, it can squeeze more output from its existing workers without drastically increasing costs. At the same time, it helps keep a lid on inflation, as companies grow without incurring new expenses that they would otherwise pass on to customers."

That followed a rise of 1.1% the month before. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3% for the second consecutive month and was up 2.5% from a year before. That is well above the Fed's ""comfort zone"" of 1.5% to 2%.""A truly ugly inflation report,"" said Harm Bandholz, economist at UniCredit Markets and Investment Banking, in a note to clients.Slower inflation may already be on the way, economists said, because of a combination of factors: the recent drop in prices for oil and other commodities; the strengthening of the dollar, which lowers the price of imports; and continued weakness in the U.S. economy.That suggests Federal Reserve policy makers are unlikely to raise interest rates despite their policy statement last week that inflation remains a ""significant"" concern.

0,"With the sort of attention usually reserved for royal weddings, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve convenes today and tomorrow to determine whether or not to leave the current federal funds rate unchanged. In the course of their deliberations, which closely resemble an academic seminar, the Fed governors will take into account everything from the unexpectedly large increase in the April consumer price index to its benign follow-up in May to Japan's first-quarter growth. The probable result of all this activity: a rate hike of one-quarter of one percentage point.Why so much attention to an event once known only to Fed watchers at investment banks? The reason has little to do with whether and by how much the Fed raises the rate, though this will of course have some bearing on the immediate direction of the markets. What really matters, however, is what the Fed's action suggests about its view of the future of inflation.After decades in which mainstream economists held that the costs of inflation were negligible, and that an inflationary monetary policy could stimulate economic growth, it is now widely appreciated (thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Martin Feldstein and others) that stable, low inflation is essential to longer expansions and stronger growth. Thus the intense speculation: Will tomorrow be the start of another ""long march,"" a 300 basis point increase such as began in 1988 and 1994 to ward off inflation? Is the Fed going to reverse the 75 basis point decrease in interest rates in response to the last year's global turmoil and the prospect of deflation?The change in forecasts of what the Fed will and should do has been rapid. As recently as late February, the Economist magazine ran a cover story worrying about the risk of global deflation; a few weeks later it hawkishly editorialized that the Fed was late in raising interest rates. Behind these large swings in opinion lie some unresolved questions about the economy, among them:-- Why has inflation continued to decelerate? Is it due to a string of one-time favorable ""shocks,"" such as low oil prices, a strong dollar, and a steeper than anticipated decline in computer prices? Has that string run out?"

I still don't think so, but it will take Fed easing to avoid it,"" said Mickey Levy, chief financial economist at NationsBank Corp. in New York.The reevaluation of the economy was triggered by the Commerce Department's report that new orders for long-lasting items, such as cars, defense equipment, machinery and appliances, tumbled 4 percent last month.

Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February.Economists believe that last month's lackluster performance in payroll growth is an indication of businesses turning more cautious in the face of profit pressures and another spike in energy prices.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 0.4% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.05 trillion. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity was relatively unchanged at 55.2 in March.

0,"As the Dow Jones industrial average hurtles toward 10,000, putting journalists in a quandary about whether to use a comma, investors are pouring more and more money into mutual funds -- a record $37.5 billion in net new cash in March. In 1980, fund investments totaled $100 billion in 12 million accounts; today, $5 trillion in 170 million accounts.Still, the majority of Americans have exactly zero dollars invested in the stock market. Some of them simply don't have the money, but many others are confused and scared, and don't know where to begin. They think they need special expertise, and they worry about being burned by unscrupulous brokers or stock manipulators. That's a shame, considering how easy it has become to own stocks and how fair and efficient our markets are.The best way to get into the stock market is to buy shares in an equity mutual fund, which is a portfolio of stocks chosen by a professional manager. When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund? That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question.Here is what I want in just-one-fund: relatively low risk; broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones; strong, consistent performance; and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds (but, curiously, not small-cap funds) grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover (which boosts tax bills) should be relatively low.One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock (1-800-645-6561), which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold. It was a match made in Wall Street heaven."

And geography is but one reason why the two-fifths of this city that sprawls north of the Santa Monica Mountains may try to do what 11 states attempted in the 1860s and 13 colonies did in 1776: declare independence.Tom McClintock, a state assemblyman, is to the San Fernando Valley's secession what John Calhoun was to the South's -- the most trenchant theorist: ""The ultimate check on an abusive or dysfunctional government is the ability of people to walk away from it."" When McClintock was a high school student in White Plains, N.Y., he came home one day to find his mother in tears over her taxes. Thus was made a young conservative and a California family: ""The ability to walk away from a dysfunctional government is what brought {my family} out here.""Now he is 41 and determined to midwife the birth of what would be the nation's sixth largest city. (Los Angeles would drop to third, behind New York and Chicago, and ahead of Houston and Philadelphia.) Sliced off of Los Angeles, the valley would be the nation's second most affluent city of more than one million. Today its per capita income is $19,021, second only to San Francisco's $19,695. In the rest of Los Angeles the figure is $14,668. The valley is 4 percent African American, 8 percent Asian American and has a large Latino population. Spanish is spoken in a quarter of all homes, and 38 percent of adults are foreign born.Los Angeles, McClintock says, grew ""like the old Soviet Union,"" by ""gobbling up"" contiguous communities, such as Hollywood and many others. It used its ownership of water rights to lure communities into an imperial city.The result is a city of 467 square miles, large enough to hold St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Boston and Pittsburgh, with room remaining for Manhattan. Another result, says McClintock, is a city where ""local government is not local."""

He attributed this in part to tax law changes, including the phasing out of many deductions, that apparently have caused individuals and businesses to increase payments of estimated taxes.At the same time, however, the Commerce Department has said that in January some people were having too little tax withheld from their paychecks because they hadn't accurately readjusted their withholding under the new law.

Some observers had expected the council to ease one or another of the central bank's key interest rates after Karl Otto Poehl, president of the bank, had said earlier this week there was ""downside maneuvering room"" for West German interest rates.Most West German interest rates now are only slightly lower than U.S. interest rates, which has lessened the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments.In late European trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 3.0355 marks, slightly above the late New York quote of 3.0320 marks on Wednesday.

Some investors believe Katrina will hold the stock market back, as rising oil prices and shipping disruptions hurt corporate profits and economic growth. Others think Katrina actually could help stocks in the longer term, since the rebuilding effort eventually should spur consumption and investment in new equipment.

The dollar at one point climbed to $1.2338 to the euro from an all-time low of $1.2897, set earlier in January.Many sages said the time was just ripe for a brief dollar recovery and that the dollar's downward creep would continue soon afterward. The dollar's brief boost, they say, was simply caused by European officials jawboning in its favor, the Federal Reserve hinting that U.S. interest rates could be headed higher and finance officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations preparing for their meeting this weekend.Indeed, that consensus appeared to be right when the dollar's decline started again a little less than two weeks ago. In late New York trading yesterday, the euro was changing hands at $1.2545, less than 3% below its record high. After all, ""nothing much has changed in underlying fundamentals,"" says Carl Weinberg, chief economist at consulting firm High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.Is that consensus too pessimistic about the dollar's prospects? While many certainly back the dollar-will-weaken view, there are some good arguments worth airing as to why the dollar's selloff may have gone too far, meaning the U.S. currency could actually strengthen against the euro this year."

The reality is that most of the day's 7.13% loss occurred in the first hour of trading, and remained fairly flat through the day.A 684-point drop is a rough ride, and the burden on the market at the opening bell was substantial. The economy before last week was already in the doldrums, with little upside evident so far from a series of interest rate cuts, or for that matter the tax rebate.

0,"Author: Ben LevisohnBond yields hit record lows again this week. Is it time to start positioning your portfolio for rising rates?At first blush such a move might seem like portfolio suicide. The main drivers of rising interest rates--economic growth and inflation--are nowhere in sight. In fact, Treasury yields could fall further if the Federal Reserve starts buying bonds again in a widely anticipated maneuver known as ""quantitative easing.""But step back from day-to-day market gyrations and a different picture emerges. Bond yields have fallen for most of the past three decades. A $1,000 investment in the U.S. government debt in 1980 would be worth about $12,970 today, according to the Ryan Labs Treasury Composite Index. Treasury prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, have surged 9.3% this year alone.Now consider a different era: 1949 through 1979. Over that 30-year span, a $1,000 initial investment in Treasurys would have turned into a far humbler $2,950. That's because yields soared during the period; by 1980 the yield on the 10-year Treasury had reached a record high of nearly 16%."
0,"The sad spectacle of the U.S. political leadership's fruitless negotiations over the past several months - or is it years now? - to reduce the country's increasingly hard-to-finance budget deficit has prompted some observers to talk about the ""Latinamericanization"" of the U.S. economy. They refer, presumably, to Latin America's unhappy experience for almost a decade with huge external debt, large budget deficits fueled by too much spending and too few taxes, and closed economies protecting inefficient local industry. Indeed, this characterization of the U.S. economy seems uncomfortably apt.However, at least one Latin American country stands out as a model of economic modernization, and the United States would do well to emulate its commitment to budget and tax reform. Mexico - yes, Mexico - has demonstrated greater courage, foresight and political will to tackle its economic problems than has its more powerful neighbor to the north. And it is now beginning to enjoy the fruits of those endeavors.Obviously the countries are vastly different in terms of their economic power. Nevertheless, they share startlingly similar problems, which Mexico has done a better job of solving. After a long spending spree, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 18 percent of gross domestic product by 1982. Through a combination of gut-wrenching cuts in spending and far-reaching tax reform, Mexico's budget today is essentially in balance. Mexico delights in pointing out, accurately, that it has put into effect the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Would that our government could achieve even one.The United States runs chronic trade deficits, and protectionist sentiment, especially in Congress, is strong. The most recent manifestation, coming on the heels of many others, is the textile bill. Though vetoed by the president, it reflects a political consensus in this country that certain sectors, both industrial and agricultural, still need to be protected. Compared with a decade ago, restraints on U.S. imports have doubled. At least 20 percent of U.S. imports are limited by some form of non-tariff barrier, thus not only depriving the consumer of cheaper imports but also subsidizing noncompetitive industry.Mexico, on the other hand, has dramatically reduced import barriers, transforming itself from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open. Non-oil exports have quadrupled, and Mexico has become a world-class producer of automobiles, automotive parts, televisions, computer chips and satellite and aircraft components."

1,"WASHINGTON -- Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee proposed an ambitious plan to raise taxes and to constrict the growth in federal spending, including Social Security benefits.In a bold attempt to redirect the fiscal debate this year, the Illinois Democrat derided as politically expedient the growing interest among prominent members of both parties to cut taxes and to avoid making the hard choices that he said are needed to reduce the budget deficit.Instead, he proposed to eschew all tax cuts, raise the top individual tax rate to 33% from 28% and freeze most federal spending programs, including Social Security, for one year. He also would raise taxes on gasoline, beer, wine, cigarettes and industrial pollutants, and would cut military spending by 3% from current levels.

On CBS-TV's ""Face the Nation"" yesterday, Mr. Rostenkowski acknowledged his plan is controversial. He said that he expected to be ""verbally hazed by both Democrats and Republicans"" and that the few colleagues he told about his plan asked, ""Do you know what you're doing?""What's more, efforts to cut taxes, especially President Bush's plan to reduce the tax on capital gains, have a good chance of passage this year over Mr. Rostenkowski's objections, according to Ways and Means aides. The capital-gains plan, which passed the House last year, is supported by a solid though narrow majority of the 36 members on Mr. Rostenkowski's own Ways and Means Committee."

The deficit applied constraints that made major policy changes almost impossible. Incrementalism ruled, and that's been a good thing.As the growth of government has slowed, the growth of the private sector has accelerated, and the nation has become more prosperous. In a kind of ironic feedback loop, that prosperity has led to increased tax revenues, which have brought down the deficit and led us to 1998, the Year of the Surplus.And so, in this new Washington, for the the first time since the Vietnam War, there's money to spend.

At the moment, most indicators point to an economy that is picking up, not sputtering out.But the stubborn intransigence of the trade figures, despite Treasury Secretary James Baker's policy to devalue the dollar, suggests no other medicine may be strong enough.

1,"WASHINGTON -- Some of the most popular provisions in President Bush's tax-cut package could get whittled down as Senate Republicans try to make room for the White House's top priority: repealing the tax that individuals pay on corporate dividends.One benefit in Mr. Bush's proposal would boost the child tax credit to $1,000 from the current $600. The jump is expensive -- nearly $90 billion through 2013, official estimates show. By limiting the increase to one year, as some Senate tax writers are now considering, the price tag would shrivel to about $15 billion.Another provision Republicans may target would triple the expensing limit for small businesses. The annual cap today is $25,000; under Mr. Bush's proposal, it would immediately rise to $75,000, carrying an estimated cost of about $29 billion over the next 10 years. Republicans are eyeing cheaper options, such as only doubling the cap and letting it to expire after a few years.The changes are necessary if the Senate is to stay within its budget limit of a $350 billion, 10-year tax-cut package. If tax writers can find ways to offset extra costs, the final figure could grow to $400 billion.Despite the $350 billion lid -- set by Republican moderates who worry about the ballooning federal deficit -- Mr. Bush wants Congress to approve the dividend-tax repeal that is the centerpiece of his economic-growth plan. That package, unveiled in January, has a 10-year price tag of $725 billion, more than half for dividend-tax relief."

1,"WASHINGTON -- The slight acceleration in August consumer prices sparked considerable disagreement among economists about the outlook for inflation.Many analysts said the 0.5% rise in prices last month signaled the start of a modest pickup in inflation, perhaps to as much as a 6% annual rate, that will continue at least through year-end. But others said the increase will be followed by smaller price rises in coming months.The August increase, which equaled 5.5% at a compounded annual rate, followed a July rise of 0.3%, or 3.5% at a compounded annual rate, the Labor Department reported Friday. The August rise was the largest since a 0.5% increase in April.Fruit and vegetable prices, which surged 3.3% last month, accounted for much of the overall price increase. Apparel prices also rose sharply, and gasoline prices declined less than in July. All figures are seasonally adjusted.""I'm afraid this is the beginning of higher inflation,"" said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University.

Downgrades ""would be devastating"" for banks, Mr. Di Mattia said.Fitch Ratings cut its credit ratings on one closely held bond guarantor, FGIC, a major player in municipal-bond insurance.

The 30-year bond was the biggest winner and its yield, which moves inversely to its bond price, tumbled about 0.47 percentage point for the week. That was the biggest weekly decline since December 2008 when Treasury prices soared on the financial crisis.The benchmark 10-year note was 27/32 lower to yield 1.810%. The 30-year bond was 1 28/32 lower to yield 2.872%. The two-year note was 1/32 lower to yield 0.214%.Some traders were quick to claim that it was a sign that a correction is due for the ferocious strength over the past seven months. The benchmark 10-year yield has tumbled from this year's peak of 3.77% in February and earlier Friday touched a fresh historic low of 1.672%.Demand for safe-haven Treasurys had intensified this month due to rising fears about the global economy and the euro-zone's debt crisis. The Federal Reserve's announcement earlier this week to sell $400 billion short-dated bonds to buy longer-dated Treasurys triggered more flight into the 10-year and 30-year Treasurys.

1,"The Washington metropolitan area's economy stumbled slightly in February, but promises to turn in a positive performance for the first quarter and the rest of the year, according to the Greater Washington Research Center.The Research Center said that indicators that measure the economy's current health weakened in February, in part because of poor weather but also because ""the economy is not strong enough to keep driving ahead at an increasing rate,"" according to Steve Fuller, an urban affairs specialist for George Washington University who tracks the local economy for the center.Fuller added, however, that the center's leading indicators, which forecast growth approximately six months into the future, were all stronger in February than a month before. It was the first time in 11 months that all the leading indicators were positive, he said.Despite weakness in February and continuing bad weather into the spring, the Washington area economy appears to have turned in a positive performance for the first three months of the year, according to Fuller. Early data indicate that installation of basic business telephone service was up 37 percent from a year earlier, with most of the growth in Northern Virginia. Housing sales were up slightly, despite worse weather this year than last, Fuller said, and employment more than doubled in the first three months of 1993 over a year earlier. Unemployment in March was 4.4 percent, compared with 5.3 percent a year earlier, he noted.Fuller said that data on employment appears to suggest that jobs are being created in start-up enterprises or by area residents becoming self-employed."

0,"Uncertainty Abounds Around Rate RiseThe Federal Reserve faces two big policy questions: when to raise rates, and how to go about raising them.After last Thursday's strong jobs report, the day the Fed begins raising rates seems closer. With the unemployment rate falling to 6.1% in June from 6.3% in May, several economists brought forward forecasts for when the first rate increase will come. Federal-funds futures, which price off Fed policy expectations, imply the target rate will be 0.5% by August 2015 versus near-zero today.But there still is a great deal of uncertainty on when ""liftoff,"" as Fed policy makers call it, will occur. That is largely because the unemployment rate doesn't seem to be fully capturing how much slack remains in the job market.There is no way to know how many of the people who left the labor force during the recession and its aftermath, and who therefore aren't counted among the unemployed, will return to the job hunt. That makes it hard to tell when wages, and inflation, might start to really heat up."

""This is a far grimmer forecast than we ought to have,"" he added. As result, he said, he favors ""much more [monetary] accommodation than we've put in place.""The comments are significant because Mr. Evans tends to reflect the broad center of gravity at the central bank. His prescription for aggressive action, though not uniformly held by his colleagues, suggests a shift in the mood at the Fed.On the heels of remarks by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley, it is likely to reinforce a growing conviction among investors that the Fed will restart a bond-buying program when it meets Nov. 2 and 3.It also suggests Fed deliberations are going beyond resuming bond-buying plans to contemplating new strategies for inflation and for communicating the Fed's stance to the public."

Analysts estimate $45 billion to $50 billion in foreign investment is needed each month to finance the U.S. current-account gap, the broadest gauge of the nation's global trade. It stood at a record $144.9 billion in the first quarter.So far this year, foreign net purchases of U.S. securities are averaging around $75 billion a month, up from about $50 billion a month last year, analysts say. ""Worries about the ability of the U.S. to finance its twin deficits -- the current-account deficit and budget deficit -- remain overblown,"" said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond-market strategist at Miller Tabak.The June foreign-investment data exceeded financial markets' expectations that net purchases would be between $50 billion and $60 billion.

But higher oil prices and the growing suspicion that the Federal Reserve won't relax its grip on interest rates anytime soon caused long-term bonds to drop slightly. The dollar strengthened as currency traders also had second thoughts about Fed policy.As expected, the stock market opened on a down note as investors took profits following the nearly 42-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday. That gain was prompted by a lower-than-expected rise in the March consumer-price index and a sharp drop in housing starts in March. Investors interpreted those figures to mean that the economy is slowing and inflation pressures are fading. But prices quickly recovered and remained higher throughout the day.A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, warned that stock investors appear to be buying the argument -- which he rejects -- that a slower economy will be good for stocks because inflationary pressures will ease.

In addition, there's a concern that U.S. consumer spending is weakening even as corporations and retailers continue to expand. Most of the revisions have come in the past week, following a sharp decline in many world markets, and despite a sharp rebound on Wall Street and elsewhere.The downward revisions to gross domestic product-the government's primary barometer of economic growthcame from economists at Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., ISI Group and several others. The size of their revisions were unusually large, even for market-oriented economists who react quickly to changing economic news.Chase Manhattan, the nation's largest banking concern, raised eyebrows when it told clients Tuesday that it revised its 1998 forecast to between 1% and 1.5% from 1.5% to 2%. The bank's chief economist, John Lipsky, began his special report, ""Reassessing Risks to the 1998 Outlook,"" by saying even though ""relative calm has returned to global financial markets,"" he felt it would be ""premature to presume that this chapter is closed.""Although Mr. Lipsky's sentiments were echoed by many other economists on Wall Street, academic and corporate economists are taking a more sanguine view of the economy. The monthly consensus forecast due next week from Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an Alexandria, Va., firm that collects the forecasts of about 50 economists and calculates a consensus, is not likely to show much change, if any, from its early October consensus. The Blue Chip consensus forecast published last month called for growth of 2.5% in 1998, down from an expected 3.6% in 1997.

This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record. Perhaps this will be the case, but experience suggests otherwise."

0,"The U.S. economy has hit a bump. In the first quarter of 1998 it grew at an annualized rate of 5.4%. The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1% or 2%. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable.Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies.Why does this matter to us? The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of $15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, ""almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles."" The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home."

Baker III appeared to have made a major gain yesterday in his efforts to buoy the world economy.The decision yesterday by seven European central banks to lower key interest ratescapped a 10-day period during which European governments announced a steady stream of fiscal and monetary measures aimed at spurring economic growth. The actions, which Baker strongly urged, raised hopes that the Treasury chief will soon engineer an international agreement designed to check the dollar's precipitous fall, hold down interest rates and avert worldwide recession.Such an agreement, in turn, could bolster Baker's hopes of keeping the economy afloat during the 1988 election campaign, with obvious benefits for the Republican side.But many economists caution that Baker's initiatives won't fundamentally alter the global economy's underlying problems. In their view, Baker appears to be obtaining only modest progress toward shrinking the huge U.S. budget and trade deficits and the need to borrow vast sums of money from abroad.And as yesterday's steep stock market decline makes plain, Baker's efforts may not be enough to ward off new waves of pessimism in financial markets in the months ahead."

As the impact of those forces wanes, so, too, will the nation's growth rate, which is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year and stay there for 1999 and 2000.""We have had an utterly exceptional rate of growth,"" which has reduced unemployment to a level at or below that regarded as full employment by many economists, CEA Chairman Janet L.

0,"INFLATION. DEFLATION. Disinflation. The economic lexicon is garbled with so many 'flations these days, it's getting a little hard to make sense of them all. During the 1970s, '80s and '90s, Washington policy makers waged a persistent battle against inflation, broadly defined as rising consumer prices. But for most of this year, as the inflation rate has fallen closer to zero, economists began to worry about the opposite trend -- the possibility that the U.S. could face Japan-style deflation, or falling consumer prices.As we enter 2003, here comes a new watchword: reflation. The term refers to government efforts to pump up -- or reflate -- an economy that is stuck in a slump by flooding that economy with money. Essentially, reflation is the intentional effort by governments to ward off deflation by boosting demand and underpinning prices. Though it isn't quite the same as inflation, reflation can spark inflation problems if policy makers go too far.The term is popping up often. In a recent report titled ""The Reflation Trade,"" Morgan Stanley Co. chief economist Stephen Roach argued that policy makers are now in a ""full-scale frontal assault on the perils of deflation."" That has made him more bullish on the stock market in the months ahead. James Grant, in his twice-monthly newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, writes about a ""global reflation program"" being led by the U.S. and spreading world-wide. That, he said, explains why prices for gold -- a hedge against inflation and his favorite investment -- are on the rise.SOME ECONOMISTS who have been beating deflation drums are doing an about-face. ""There has been an important shift. The financial community is talking more about reflation . . . it is the thing to watch in 2003,"" says Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., the California bond-fund manager that recently advised clients that government-bond yields will rise as result of today's reflation tilt.Behind the reflation focus is blunt talk by Federal Reserve officials. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told economists in New York that while deflation is only a remote possibility, the central bank is ""extraordinarily sensitive"" to the potential perils associated with it and is prepared to forestall it if the economy moves further in that direction. In November, Fed governor Ben Bernanke laid out a series of unusual steps the Fed could take to get out of Japan-style deflation if it did happen -- such as lending more aggressively to banks to drive down private borrowing costs or buying foreign government bonds, which could weaken the dollar and boost exports."

This rapid down-and-up suggested to some analysts that the August increase in unemployment was overstated, and that much of the September improvement was also a statistical mirage.Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, told Congress' Joint Economic Committee (JEC) that neither the survey of American households nor that of businesses yet sho'yvs any unmistakable signs of labor market recession.Nevertheless, most economic forecasters still believe the economy, if not already in a recession, will be soon."

It assumes that voters are ready to forgive President Reagan for his ill-conceived Economic Recovery Program, that supply-side fantasy that sent the economy into a tailspin, idling 33 percent of the nation's productive capacity, driving unemployment up to 12 million, creating over $400 billion in deficits, boosting mortgage interest to 18 percent and, in the process, forcing cutbacks in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment compensation.That sort of polity, and the pall it cast over the economy until last summer, are not so quickly forgotten. The way Democrats can keep the issue alive is by pointing to the next four years. Long after the need for a shift in economic policy became imperative, Reagan was the one who insisted on staying the course. So it is almost certain that, at the first sign of renewed inflation, a second Reagan administration would send the average American through the economic wringer again. All of those who lost their jobs before would be out on the street again.If this does not have the makings of an effective election issue, I don't know one when I see it. With some of the best media experts in the country on their side, such as Norman Lear, David Sawyer, Tony Schwartz and Robert Squier, the Democrats can present the economic issue in countless and ingenious ways.There is an even better reason for Democrats to stress the home front this year. The party out of power takes a real risk when it campaigns on foreign policy. An incumbent president controls both the initiative and the information in foreign policy.

1,"WASHINGTON -- Production by U.S. factories, mines and utilities continued to accelerate in April, offering further evidence of the economy's strength in the face of rising interest rates.Industrial output jumped 0.9% last month from March, its fastest pace in almost two years, the Federal Reserve said. Output is now 6.1% higher than it was a year earlier. The March gain, meanwhile, was revised upward to 0.7%, sharply higher than the preliminary estimate of a 0.3% increase. Taken together, the numbers suggest that U.S. industrial production continues to gain strength and that the April increase isn't a one-month anomaly.With suppliers straining to keep up with strong consumer and business demand, the nation's capacity-utilization rate jumped 0.4% to 82.1%, the first time that the index has climbed above 82% in about two years. Utilization rates of less than 84%, however, suggest that manufacturers have enough slack to increase output without triggering production delays or bottlenecksThe report came as the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee prepared to meet here to consider a further interest-rate increase designed to slow the pace of the economy's growth while keeping inflation under wraps. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point five times since last June, but is widely expected to choose a more aggressive, half-point increase at its meeting today. A half-point move would bring the federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to its highest level in about nine years.Still, yesterday's report offers some good news on the inflation front. Most of the overall increase in industrial output came about because of a 1.6% run-up in production of computers and other information-processing hardware and software. This and other technology have helped spark the massive productivity gains, which have held inflation in check in recent years. Technology production rose 2.7% in April, and is up an eye-popping 59% year over year. Consumer goods production, by comparison, increased 0.6% after being flat the last two months."

A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; a reading below 50% signals contraction.While the growth is positive news for the manufacturing sector, which seemed to be leading an economic recovery last summer before petering to stagnation, it is much slower than the growth posted in February and March. After a dismal 47.4% showing in both January and December, the index posted a 52.4% reading in February and jumped to 54.1% in March.But the association's survey chairman, Robert Bretz, said the survey's findings are still encouraging even if the index number was lower. ""The growth in new orders continues at a relatively high rate and that means more production,"" said Mr. Bretz, who is also director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc.Production and new orders for exports and imports also grew in April, although at slower rates than in March.

Warburg & Co. in New York. Gross domestic product is the value of goods and services produced in the U.S.The widening trade gap was attributed to an increase in imports of computers, cars and other consumer goods and a decline in exports of telecommunications equipment and industrial supplies.Although the trade surplus with Japan actually improved slightly -- narrowing to $5.87 billion in April from $6.14 billion the month before -- imports of new Japanese cars to the U.S. grew to $2.4 billion. That was the second-highest figure on record and a point that is certain to put additional pressure on the Clinton administration to keep a tough stance in its battle to force Japan to open its markets to American-made autos and auto parts. Washington has threatened to impose big tariffs on Japanese luxury cars starting June 28 unless an agreement with Japan is hammered out this week in Geneva.

It marks the fifth-straight monthly decline and a stunning reversal in just a few short months from the price pressures seen in mid-2008.The lower prices bring some much-needed relief to hard-pressed businesses as the U.S. recession marches on -- but they also reflect weakness in global demand for goods. Manufacturing activity is down sharply in the world's biggest economies, including the U.S., Japan and Europe; it also has slowed in markets like China that once had enormous demand for raw materials. U.S. producer prices in December were down 0.9% from the previous year, the biggest yearly drop since 2001.Energy prices fell 9.3% last month from November, as wholesale gasoline prices tumbled 25.7%. Food prices declined 1.5%. The declines are expected to be passed on to consumers, as businesses work to attract customers through heavy discounting. The Labor Department will release its December consumer prices on Friday.Excluding food and energy, core producer prices held up last month, rising 0.2% from November and 4.3% from the previous year -- the largest annual gain in two decades. But core prices are expected to decline in the months ahead, which, combined with falling wages, is stoking concerns about a looming downward spiral of lower prices and spending known as deflation."

But, right now, the market sees no such upset for Brilliant Ben and the Fantastic Federal Reserve, as they continue their rescue of the U.S. economy.Mr. Bernanke's extraordinary policies have undeniably succeeded in persuading investors to plow their cash hoard into riskier assets. The S&P 500 has leapt a staggering 43% in a year. Junk bonds currently yield 5.85 percentage points more than adjusted Treasury yields, according to Bank of America. That's far tighter than the 9.61 percentage points seen nine months after the 2001 recession.Indeed, only 18 months after debt markets shut down completely, companies now seem to believe that they will be open indefinitely. For instance, Fitch Ratings recently noted that corporate borrowers have started to wait to renegotiate expiring credit facilities, believing they'll get better terms in the future.The bull thesis is seductive. The easy money is creating self-sustaining growth in the real economy that will in turn provide the earnings needed to keep stock and bond prices rallying. And if first-quarter earnings exceed expectations, the upswing will likely continue.What's obvious, though, is that investors are giving little credence to the idea that the Fed could slip up. Such trust might yet prove justified. A double-dip recession doesn't look imminent. Meanwhile, the market can take comfort from the fact that the Fed hasn't allowed a serious inflation break-out since the 1970s."

0,"Gregory Mankiw spoke economic truth to the American people about offshore outsourcing and, of course, politicians from both sides of the aisle immediately attacked him and politicized the issue. What the editorial did not say, however, is why the politicians can so easily get away with their demagoguery: the complexity of economics.For example, it is easy for people who have jobs to see those jobs being preserved by government interference and impossible for people who are looking for jobs to see jobs that were never created in the first place because of that same government interference.When we wonder about the slowness of the current job recovery, we should be thinking about all the government actions that interfere with job creation, including payroll taxes, protectionist quotas and subsidies to favored businesses, excessive regulations that weaken our companies, massive federal spending and deficits, and overly generous unemployment benefits that subsidize voluntary unemployment and discourage employment flexibility.In the long run, your editorial on outsourcing is correct. But as John Maynard Keynes said, ""In the long run, we are all dead.""In the short run, a government of the people, by the people and for the people should ameliorate the worst effects of offshoring on U.S. workers rather than accelerate offshoring for the benefit of U.S. corporations."

That's due in part to a robust November that lured shoppers with discounts galore as well as the retailers' ability to keep inventories and expenses in line after having tough lessons learned during the recession.That's the good news. With mounting prices on everything from fuel and food to cotton, retailers still are expected to offer muted full-year earnings guidance for 2011. Broad inflation hasn't beset clothing makers and sellers in almost two decades and rising costs will pose a quandary for stores: Do they pass those higher costs onto still-strapped consumers, who may in turn buy less? Or do they absorb some of the cost and take a hit to their gross profit margins?The first half of the year poses additional challenges, particularly for department stores and discounter Target Corp. They will be lapping their toughest sales comparisons from a year ago.""Most companies will provide conservative, cautiously optimistic guidance due to increasingly tough comparisons, erratic consumer spending trends (with a growing divide between wealthy and poor) and perhaps most importantly, apparel inflation,"" Bill Dreher, retail analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a recent report."

""With increases like these,"" he said, ""sooner or later, the consumer has to run out of gas.""The Fed report showed that consumer credit grew at a 19.75% annual rate in July, compared with an average annual pace of 24% during the second quarter and 11.5% for all of 1983.

0,"Friday's weak employment report reminds us anew of the flagging U.S. economic recovery. While the Obama administration discusses additional stimulus packages, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is arguing that we should roll back key elements of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. The administration is particularly skeptical about the benefits of today's lower rates on dividends and capital gains.The tax on dividends, for example, is currently 15%, but it could increase to as high as 39.6% if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. On top of this, a new 3.8% tax on investment incomes for high-income earners begins in 2013 to help pay for ObamaCare. The administration's arguments for higher taxes on capital center on fairness and the need for deficit reduction.These arguments are seriously mistaken. The relationship between investment, capital and wages is such that workers are better off if capital is not taxed at all.Think of the economy as a pie split among workers, savers and the government, with the government's slice fixed. The savers' slice will equal the after-tax return on each unit of the capital stock, and what's left goes to workers as after-tax wages. The fairness advocates in effect claim that low tax rates on dividends and capital gains increase the share of the pie that goes to high-income savers. But the low tax rates increase the absolute size of the workers' slice by making the entire pie bigger. That's because low tax rates encourage capital accumulation, productivity and wage growth.To understand how this works, it's worthwhile to return to President Bush's proposal, in January 2003, to substantially reduce the double taxation of corporate income by eliminating investor-level taxes on dividends. (The actual law reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains to 15%.)"

1,"The U.S. economy beefed up over the summer, despite weak-kneed financial and housing markets. Still, investors aren't expecting the data to keep the Federal Reserve from taking another whack at interest rates today.In its first pass at calculating growth for the July-through- September quarter, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the economy's physique -- rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, up a tick from the second quarter's 3.8% growth and besting the guesses of 24 Wall Street shamans surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Their consensus call was 3.2% GDP growth during the quarter. True enough, there was housing-related softness in the report, as residential investment tumbled 20% and zapped more than a percentage point of growth out of the final number. But there were plenty of off-setting bright spots, such as the undaunted millions piloting our national fleet of shopping carts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump. In a separate report, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly jumped in September, with government-financed projects picking up the slack in the housing sector.Alas, nothing is simple for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his elite squad of econo-wonks, who are, as of this writing, putting final flourishes on their latest masterpiece of a press release announcing their decision on interest rates. (It's due at 2:15 p.m.). The rosier- than-expected GDP and construction numbers might not have much bearing on the Fed's decision-making, which most handicappers expect will produce a quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate. That is mostly because these numbers offer a slightly stale view of the economy. ""The question now is how well it can withstand even steeper declines in residential construction, the general tightening in credit conditions, falling house prices, oil prices at around $90 per barrel, and their negative implications for consumer and business spending,"" wrote Nigel Gault, an economist with research firm Global Insight. Such stresses would help make the case for easier credit.But not all dismal scientists discounted today's GDP figures. At Nomura Securities, analysts wrote that ""the surprising GDP strength could be enough to persuade the FOMC to defer any decision about the need for another rate cut until a clearer picture of the fourth quarter has formed."" And analysts with Bear Stearns wrapped up their GDP commentary by noting refound strength in an employment report from payroll processing giant ADP. ""With the evidence [from this morning's ADP report] suggesting that private payrolls grew around 100,000 in October, and with back-to-back quarters of near 4% real GDP growth, the economic argument for a further rate cut at this point is unclear to us.""

Unless productivity-output per hour worked-also rose, a faster rate of wage change likely would mean higher inflation. Some expected that lower unemployment would raise employment costs by increasing competition to hire workers.However, the quarterly increase in the index was almost identical to a 1.1 percent rise in the third quarter of last year. The index rose 0.7 percent in the second quarter, but because the figures are not adjusted for seasonal variation, comparing changes from one quarter to the next may be misleading.For the 12 months ended in June, the increase was 3.3 percent, slightly less than the 3.4 percent in the year ended in September.

Who could possibly have imagined a year ago that overall business activity -- notwithstanding an unprecedented crash in the stock market -- would remain briskly on the rise in mid-1988? Who could have guessed that the expansion would be rolling relentlessly through a sixth straight year, with no end in sight?Economists who failed to anticipate this durability may be tempted to despair, sensing that imponderables so overhang the business scene nowadays that forecasting has grown too hazardous an occupation. Indeed, they may be moved to seek safer work, like wrestling with alligators instead of numbers.Before anyone sets out for the Everglades, however, it may be worth taking a retrospective look at the economy's recent behavior, for it's not as perplexing as one might suppose from all the tarnished forecasting records.Expansion phases of the business cycle normally end only after a rising economy begins to bump against constraints to further growth. These constraints may be physical, as when labor or productive capacity proves insufficient to meet demand, or they may be financial, as when credit is too costly or simply unavailable.This basic characteristic of the business cycle tended to be overlooked in the widespread concern last year, particularly after the October market crash, that a recession would soon set in, possibly by the start of 1988."

1,"From hero to zero in just 10 days: May's selloff has seen year-to-date gains for holders of U.S. Treasurys, German bunds and U.K. gilts wiped out and turned to losses. Some are asking if this is a definitive turning point for the bond market after its 30-year bull run. It isn't clear yet that global yields have hit bottom--but it is clear that bonds are becoming hypersensitive to the smallest twists and turns in the economy.The turn in mood has been sharp. On May 2, after the European Central Bank cut rates and hinted that it might yet push the rate on its deposit facility into negative territory, 10-year German yields hit a record low around 1.15%; U.S. yields were at a low for the year of 1.63%. But since then, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, some encouraging German industrial data and a brewing debate about how and when the U.S. Federal Reserve might wind down its bond-purchase program have pushed yields sharply higher, to 1.36% in Germany and 1.92% in the U.S. Gilt yields have broadly tracked Treasurys.But none of the data yet suggest an economy that is standing on firm ground: U.S. payrolls growth of 165,000 in April was better than expected, but hardly stellar, albeit prior months were also revised upward. Better data for Germany is welcome, but is unlikely to pull the euro zone as a whole out of its extended slump. Other indicators continue to suggest a soft patch. Most significantly, key measures of inflation have been falling, which should be bond-friendly: In the U.S., the core Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, has dropped to 1.1%, while euro-zone inflation is estimated at 1.2% in April, down from 1.7% in March. And since the start of May, the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Korea have all cut rates--between them accounting for some 23% of world GDP, notes Deutsche Bank.Further falls in inflation may yet scotch talk of tapering bond purchases in the U.S. In the euro zone, the ECB may yet become more dovish. And the full effects of the Bank of Japan's new activism have yet to be seen--although Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds have now turned positive, another potential support for U.S. and European markets.Still, the violence of May's selloff suggests that with yields at such low levels, investors are very sensitive to any data that goes against expectations and are very quick to try to judge what that means for central-bank policy. That means more volatility lies ahead. Investors should watch out."

In addition to the rate boosts, the Fed termed signs of slowing as ""tentative"" and hinted that the economy remains quite vigorous, even as it raised rates for the seventh time in about one year.The language that accompanied the Fed's move, especially about inflation and capacity utilization, along with the unanimous vote, telegraphed a certain sense of concern to the bond market,"" said Frazier Evans, senior economist for Colonial Investment Services.In the stock market, a mild rally in cyclical issues rapidly escalated into a fierce argument between the two warring constituencies seeking control of the stock market.

1,"WASHINGTON -- When the Commerce Department released figures late last year showing a substantial improvement in economic growth during the fourth quarter of 1984, the news was cheered by traders, economic analysts and politicians alike.But last week the department released revised figures indicating those cheers were for nought. Instead of growing at an inflation-adjusted 4.3% rate, as previously thought, the new figures showed economic growth was limping in the fourth quarter of 1984 at a meager 0.6% pace.That drastic change illustrates how the highly technical ""benchmark"" statistical revisions completed recently by the department have revamped the economic landscape. The department is the sole source of statistics on the nation's total output, or gross national product, and when it alters its numbers, it alters everyone else's view of the world.The department's revisions altered virtually all the GNP figures back to 1972, and in some cases reached as far back as 1929. The revisions reflected newly available information, improved estimating techniques and a shift in the price ""base,"" used in adjusting GNP for inflation, to 1982 from 1972.For the Reagan administration, the revisions make the economic record look less successful. The revisions show, among other things, that the 1982 recession was more severe than previously thought, and that the expansion that has followed isn't quite as strong as earlier statistics had suggested."

In May of last year, Mr. Hall and his colleagues believed the latest recession might be over. Consumers were spending more and economic output was rising. All that the committee members needed to see was a few months of uninterrupted job growth to announce the end of the recession. ""It seemed like the timing was imminent,"" he says.But Mr. Hall is still waiting. Instead of expanding employment, companies are continuing to shed jobs at a furious pace -- 525,000 nonfarm payroll positions in the past three months alone. Since March 2001, when the recession began, the U.S. economy has lost 2.1 million jobs. The total number of people unemployed -- including discouraged workers who would prefer to work but have stopped looking -- is about 9.2 million. And the number of people who are working part time because they can't find full-time work is 4.8 million, up 46% since 2001, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In short, the U.S. is experiencing the most protracted job-market downturn since the Great Depression.

The revised numbers were based on more complete source data, some of which is estimated in the advance release.This latest evidence that the economy is surging ahead pushed up short-term interest rates yesterday. Investors and traders said they expect the Federal Reserve might seek to cool off the economy by providing less cash to the banking system, a move that would boost key overnight interest rates again. The Fed raised its target for overnight rates earlier this month by three-fourths of a percentage point, the sixth increase this year.However, some analysts said the Fed likely would leave rates unchanged for the next two months as its policy makers wait to see whether this year's rate increases begin to slow economic growth.

0,"WASHINGTON -- America's extraordinarily low unemployment rate is beginning to feel pressure from the sharp economic slowdown, but not enough to prove the entire economy has followed manufacturing into recession.The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2% in January, its highest level since September 1999 but only a bit above the near-30-year low of 4% in December, the Department of Labor said Friday. In January, the labor pool expanded faster than the number of new jobs that were created.Payrolls outside of farming jumped 268,000 in January, adjusted for seasonal variation, well above what economists expected, and a big improvement over the tiny increase of 19,000 jobs in December. That increase was revised down sharply from an original estimate of 105,000. The January data suggest that employment, especially in construction where 145,000 jobs were added, had been unusually depressed by bad weather in December.The report was the first comprehensive look at the entire economy for January. Previous reports had found that the industrial sector's decline accelerated during the month, and the payroll report provided further confirmation. Manufacturing jobs sank by 65,000, bringing total losses in that sector to 254,000 since June. But employment in retail trade, government and other services rose 183,000.""It's clear you have a dichotomy between manufacturing and the rest of the economy,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va., noting that service-sector employment would have been higher but for the loss of jobs at temporary-help agencies, many of which were actually at manufacturing companies."
0,"Companies continued to shed workers in April, and the latest data gave little indication that a significant job-market rebound is imminent.In its latest monthly employment report, the Labor Department said U.S. nonagricultural companies eliminated 48,000 payroll jobs last month, following a combined decline of 477,000 jobs in February and March. Although the decline wasn't as steep as some had expected, other statistics in the report clearly suggested that the labor market is weaker than many economists anticipated.For example, job losses in the manufacturing sector were enormous; jobs fell 95,000 in April. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6% from 5.8%. Most troublesome, the average workweek fell 0.3 hour, an indication that companies don't have enough work to occupy even those employees that remain after the latest cuts. Many economists say hiring will pick up only after there is an uptick in hours worked, since companies generally try to make their existing employees work longer before they hire additional people.In Washington, President Bush used the jump in the unemployment rate to spur members of Congress to pass a ""robust"" tax-cut package to stimulate the economy. Speaking to defense workers in California, the president took the issue of the rising jobless rate, a potential political liability, and turned it to his advantage. The rising unemployment rate, he said, ""should serve as a clear signal to the United States Congress we need a bold economic recovery package so people can find work.""Since the jobs report shows no sign of the postwar pickup that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting, it will probably make some already-pessimistic Fed officials even more convinced an immediate cut in interest rates is needed. However, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that only ""limited"" information is available on the economy's performance since war uncertainty began to lift, though he already knew the job market had weakened further in April. That suggests he will counsel patience at tomorrow's central-banking meeting, rather than advocate cutting short-term rates from their current, 42-year low of 1.25%."

At the same time, the nation's pattern of importing more and more goods continued unchecked, as foreign products purchased by Americans rose 1.6 percent, or $2.6 billion, to $161.5 billion, led by oil, autos and consumer goods.The politically sensitive U.S. deficit with China narrowed in February to $13.9 billion from January's $15.3 billion level. But critics of China pointed out that the combined figure for those two months was 47 percent above the same period last year and said the report will fuel growing sentiment in Congress for a tougher policy on Beijing's trade practices.The overall gap was a record -- by itself nothing new, because the monthly trade deficit has smashed through previous highs eight times since the start of last year. But yesterday's report deepened concern that the flow of goods across U.S. borders does not seem to be responding to the dollar's fall, even though that decline has continued for three years.A cheaper dollar is supposed to spur sales of U.S. exports by making American goods more attractive to foreign purchasers, and reduce Americans' appetite for foreign products by making them more expensive.

After the recent attention to the increases in oil prices, and their contribution to the probability of a recession, it's useful to take a look at the prices of another basic commodity, steel. OPEC has held oil prices steady this year but, as you doubtless saw, intends to raise them 14.5 percent in the coming year. By an instructive coincidence, 14.5 percent is just about the average increase in steel prices over the past year, and there is more to come in January.This disproportionately fast run-up in steel prices is the result unintentional, but real of the Carter administration's attempts to protect the U.S. steel industry from its foreign competitors. The American producers had been complaining that the foreign mills were selling steel here below cost, to avoid unemployment at home. That's called dumping, and it's illegal. Just about a year ago, the Treasury Department announced its trigger price system. It calculated the real cost of making steel in the most efficient mills Japan's and any steel imported below that price was to trigger ail immediate dumping investigation. It was an ingenious idea. Unfortunately, it did not foresee the drastic rise in the value of the Japanese yen throughout 1978.As the yen soared, it took the trigger prices up \v ith it. Knowing that their foreign competitors would not come into this country below the trigger price, the American companies raised their own prices right along with the triggers. The trigger system became, in a manner of speaking, price controls in reverse. Instead of a ceiling holding prices down, for the American producers it provided a floor under prices and, as in an elevator, the floor was rising. The whole trigger experiment has become another painful example of the truth that protectionism is highly inflationary.reaction to the closing of steel mills in Ohio's Mahoning Valley, around Youngstown. The closings were blamed on the imports, and the first reports indicated vast unemployment and unbearable hardship for whole communities. But time has passed, and it has become obvious that the social impact of the closings was greatly overestimated. The current unemployment rate there is less than one percentage point higher than the national average. While the inflationary costs of the trigger prices have swollen far beyond any expectation, the social distress caused by the shutdowns of those obsolescent mills in Ohio turns out to have been, happily, much more shortlived than anyone could have hoped a year ago.What comes next? On Jan. 1, OPEC imposes a 5 percent increase. It's the first of four increments scheduled for 1979. On the same day, the Treasury has announced, the steel trigger prices will go up another 7 percent under the automatic formula. The industry has already indicated that it will follow with price increases in the range of 3.5 percent. While the causes of these rises in oil and steel prices are different, the effects will be remarkably similar."

At about $110 billion a month, that is not that far off the huge monthly net issuance Uncle Sam is churning out to fund the deficit.Strangely, the Fed's bold decision follows a period in which U.S. economic data have shown some improvement. Manufacturing activity rebounded in October, retail sales have shown surprising strength and even private-sector hiring is gradually picking up steam. Plus, there are clear risks that the Fed's action will create economic and market distortions.Yet those received little acknowledgment in the Fed's statement. The central bank's justification for the move is that unemployment, at 9.7%, remains too high, that core inflation is too low, and that lackluster gross domestic product growth is unlikely to change that soon.Also, having encouraged markets to factor in another bout of monetary experimentation, the Fed probably did not feel it had the option to disappoint.

They sometimes look past food-price increases that appear temporary or isolated while trying to control broad and long-term inflation trends, not blips that might soon reverse.The Federal Reserve faces an especially important challenge now as it mulls the long-standing dilemma of what to make of the price of a pork chop.As Fed officials debate when to start raising short-term interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and causing inflation, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has signaled she wants to take her time.Broad measures of inflation have been running below the Fed's 2% target for more than two years, but show signs of picking up.

0,"The U.S. faces an unwelcome combination of looming recession and persistent inflation that is reviving angst about stagflation, a condition not seen since the 1970s.Inflation is rising. Yesterday the Labor Department said consumer prices in the U.S. jumped 0.4% in January and are up 4.3% over the past 12 months, near a 16-year high. Even stripping out sharply rising food and energy costs, prices rose 0.3% in January, driven by education, medical care, clothing and hotels. They are up by 2.5% from the previous year, a 10-month high.The same day brought a reminder of possible recession. The Federal Reserve disclosed that its policy makers lowered their forecast for economic growth this year to between 1.3% and 2%, half a percentage point below the level of their previous forecast, in October. They blamed a further slowdown on the slump in housing prices, tighter lending standards and higher oil prices. They warned the economy's performance could fall short of even that lowered outlook.Stocks fell on the Labor Department's morning inflation report. But shares rallied after the afternoon release of the minutes of the Jan. 29-30 meeting of Fed policy makers and their latest forecast for the economy. That's because investors took the Fed's darker outlook on growth to mean that it intended to cut its short-term interest rate next month at its next scheduled meeting.A simultaneous rise in unemployment and inflation poses a dilemma for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. When the Fed wants to fight unemployment, it lowers interest rates. When it wants to damp inflation, it raises them. It's impossible to do both at the same time."

However, that was a smaller increase than in June or July, which was revised upward in yesterday's report to show a 0.9 percent gain for July, and was consistent with an overall pattern of moderate, noninflationary economic growth, a number of analysts said.Meanwhile, the Labor Department said prices charged by producers when they first sell a completed item rose 0.3 percent last month after an unprecedented string of seven straight monthly declines. The increase, which followed a cumulative drop of almost 2 percent in the producer price index in thejanuary-July period, was largely the result of a jump in energy prices, some of which have already been reversed.Over the past 12 months, producer prices for finished goods were down 0.2 percent Excluding volatile food andEconomists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Corp., a New York brokerage firm, called it another phenomenal inflation report.""

The U.S. economy has the talent, ideas, energy and capital for the robust economic growth that has characterized much of America's experience in our lifetimes. Our standard of living and the nation's standing as a world power depend on restoring that growth.But to do so we must have vastly different policies aimed at stopping runaway federal spending and debt, reforming our tax code and entitlement programs, and scaling back costly regulations. Those policies cannot be found in the president's proposals. They are, however, the core of Gov. Mitt Romney's plan for economic recovery and renewal.In response to the recession, the Obama administration chose to emphasize costly, short-term fixes--ineffective stimulus programs, myriad housing programs that went nowhere, and a rush to invest in ""green"" companies.As a consequence, uncertainty over policy--particularly over tax and regulatory policy--slowed the recovery and limited job creation. One recent study by Scott Baker and Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago found that this uncertainty reduced GDP by 1.4% in 2011 alone, and that returning to pre-crisis levels of uncertainty would add about 2.3 million jobs in just 18 months."

1,"The Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to stay the course on its asset purchases surprised and confused many market participants, who felt the central bank had sent contradictory signals about its intentions. In fact, the Fed has behaved in a way completely consistent with Chairman Ben Bernanke's public comments, at least since July. A careful look at the labor market numbers suggests that if the Fed sticks to the chairman's words, there will be no significant tapering any time soon.Before July, the Fed announced on a number of occasions that a 6.5% unemployment rate would indicate that it is time to start raising interest rates and winding down its easy-money policies. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its high of 10% in October 2009 to the mid-sevens. But the labor market is still sickly because, as I pointed out in these pages in June, the employment rate--the proportion of the working-age population that has jobs--has made little progress.The employment rate is the best single indicator of labor-market health, and it is still hovering at around 58.5%, down significantly from its pre-recession levels of over 63%. The economy is adding jobs, but just barely staying ahead of population growth. Rather than making up for ground lost during the recession, the economy is still treading water.Mr. Bernanke and other Fed governors are clearly aware of the distinction between the unemployment and employment rates. In his July 17 congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that ""if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment (my emphasis), the [Federal Open Market] Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6.5% as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate."" The jobs report for August showed the decline in labor-force participation and employment rates that the Fed feared.On Sept. 18--following the FOMC's vote to continue its current pace of bond-buying--Mr. Bernanke reinforced the message. ""The unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure in all circumstances of the state of the labor market overall,"" he said. ""We are looking for overall improvement in the labor market."""

In comments over the past few weeks, top officials have been more likely to marvel about the tameness of prices than to express concern about nascent inflation.""The sticker shock . . . exaggerates the inflation numbers,"" economists at Warburg Dillon Reed LLC wrote Friday in a report to clients, adding that the price rises ""do not represent a significant change in the underlying trend of inflation."" The Fed, too, ""will be able to look past these developments,"" the Warburg analysts concluded.

And that could mean further increases in interest rates.In some industries, factories already are operating at close to capacity and price increases are proliferating, these economists said. Although inflation isn't likely to return to double-digit territory, some analysts said they foresee consumer prices rising at a 6%-to-7% annual clip later this year, up sharply from last year's 3.8% increase.Moreover, some economists predicted that the U.S. dollar will tumble in the foreign-exchange markets this year. That would make imported goods more expensive in the U.S., intensifying inflationary pressures. As the inflation rate rises, investors will demand higher interest rates to compensate for the loss of the dollar's buying power, these analysts said.The dollar's fate ""is the wild card in the outlook for inflation and interest rates,"" said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. ""The dollar will fall at least 10%"" this year against other major currencies, he contended. There is an even chance that the dollar could plunge 20%, he added.Mr. Hale predicted that the inflation rate will rise to between 5% and 6% by autumn. The closely watched interest rate on federal funds, which has hovered at about 9 1/2% in recent months, will rise to the 10% to 11% area by year end, he said.

Spending fell less than 0.1%, after easing 0.1% in May, even though Americans' income after taxes rose 0.4%, the most since March. Consumer spending is the biggest single driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand.The pickup in saving is a two-edged sword for the economy. In the long run, saving helps Americans establish a cushion against financial setbacks and build up wealth that can fuel spending. It also helps them cope with rising gasoline and food prices. But penny-pinching sucks life out of the economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending and faces a dimming outlook as other drivers of growth lose steam.""This is good news for the future, but it provides little help to the U.S. economy,"" said Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

He figured ""there must be money out there if people are willing to pay that much"" for bluejeans. The insight -- along with reports from other clients that costs were rising -- led Mr. Sohn, 61 years old, to increase his 2005 projection for inflation and to stick with his call for healthy economic growth in the U.S.The resulting prediction of growth of about 3.8% for the first three quarters and above-trend inflation of about 3.6% left him ahead of the pack when the results were tabulated. U.S. gross domestic product expanded, on average, at a 3.7% annual rate during the first nine months, and, as of November, the consumer-price index was up 3.5% from a year earlier. Most other economists had forecast lower inflation and a little less growth in 2005.

Dewey Daane, a retired professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee; Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York; Gail Fosler, chief economist with the Conference Board in New York; and Maria Fiorini Ramirez of MFR Inc., an economic-consulting firm in New York.

But because its goal - providing universal access to health insurance at affordable prices - is shared by all the major proposals, it's a useful baseline. The impacts of the competing proposals are likely to differ more in degree than direction.Certainly no plan would generate a more complicated set of redistributions than the president's. A recent study by Lewin-VHI Inc., a health research firm in Fairfax, predicted the Clinton plan would have these effects in 1998: - Nearly one in four households would see their annual health care spending fall by more than $1,000 a year, while one in six would see it rise by that amount."

They say it's only a question of whether the drop begins soon or the decline holds off until the second half.They believe that lackluster U.S. trade results and, eventually, a slowing economy and receding U.S. interest rates will reduce the dollar's allure to traders and international investors. A lack of progress in reducing the U.S. budget deficit also could diminish foreigners' confidence in the U.S. and its currency.Last year, the dollar surprised many analysts. Expectations at the start of the year were that the U.S. currency would fall sharply, continuing a decline that began in late February 1985. Many people assumed that after the October 1987 stock market crash, dollar stability wouldn't be an important policy goal and that the currency would have to keep falling to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit.The dollar did tumble to 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks in intraday trading Jan. 4, 1988 -- its lowest levels since the modern exchange-rate system was established in the late 1940s."

Federal Reserve Board Governor Henry C. Wallich yesterday rejected t he view held by the monetarist school that strict adherence by the Fed to pre-announced money supply targets ?would lead to stabler and ultimately jower interest rates. ' In a speech in Bethesda to the Robert Morris Associates, Wallich said that it 'may seem plausible that interest rates in the long run would be lower under such tight control of monetary aggregates than a procedure that accepts temporary over- and under-shoots.But in the short run, Monetary restraint, however steady, cannot quickly bringdown inflation nor interest rates, the Fed governor asserted. The most plausible view is that the main impact of monetary restraint on prices occurs ivith a two-year lag. ' The Federal Reserve has been widely criticized this year for permitting exceedingly wide fluctuations in both interest rates and in the monetary aggregates. Influential advisers to the incoming Reagan administration, including economists Milton Friedman and Murray Weidenhaum, have joined in the policy critique.* In addition, there have been background comments implying that pressure would l>e brought to bear on the Fed to adhere more strictly to its announced monetary targets. The Fed has not commented directly on such suggestions, hut Wallich's comments clearly constituted his own rebuttal of that line of thinking.He conceded that the ups and downs of both interest rates and the supply aggregates had been wide this year, but blamed the sad record of the monetary aggregates on rapidly shifting demand for money and credit, combined with the imposition and then the removal of credit controls."

On Friday, light, sweet crude for September delivery fell 29 cents, or 0.3%, to $97.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing price since Feb. 6.A host of factors were at work, analysts and traders said, from logistical delays in the pipeline and refinery system that would damp demand for crude, to a lack of global supply problems despite violence in Iraq, Libya and Eastern Europe. Taken together, the factors resulted in traders cutting back on bets that prices would rise from the record levels reached in recent months.""As time has gone by, speculators have decided they don't want to wait much longer for an actual impact on oil supply,"" said Mark Vonderheide, managing partner of trading firm Geneva Energy Markets.Last week, a fire caused CVR Refining LP to shut down its 115,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Coffeyville, Kan., for repairs, the latest problem for U.S. crude.

The leading-indicators index, considered a reasonable predictor of turning points in the economy, measured 105.2, up from 105 in February.The March increase came largely from two of the 10 components that make up the index: stock prices and money supply. Both of those measures reflect the strength of financial markets and are considered fairly reliable indicators of the strength of future economic growth, not just of whether the economy will stay out of recession.Other increases were seen in orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a measure of suppliers' delivery times. Declines were seen in big-ticket orders to manufacturers, excluding defense contracts."

That is a cause for frustration, if not outrage.The question is, outrage at whom? On Wednesday, Occupy Wall Street marched on J.P. Morgan Chase's headquarters, after having protested outside CEO Jamie Dimon's home the previous day. That's odd, seeing that J.P.

1,"NEW YORK -- The economy maintained a hearty pace in November, though it slipped slightly from the previous month's surprisingly robust level, the nation's purchasing managers said.The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that production and new order rates slowed from the previous month, but employment rose at the strongest rate in the past 12 months.""November's robust showing underscores the strength remaining in the economy as it entered the seventh year of recovery,"" said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's national business survey committee.Coming on the heels of the Labor Department's unexpectedly strong November job growth report on Friday, the purchasers' survey could exacerbate concern that the economy isn't cooling down as neatly or as notably as many economists thought. A too-strong economy raises worries that the Federal Reserve Board may curb credit in an effort to head off worrisome inflation.The economy has been giving some mixed signals lately, and the purchasers' report also contains some disparate views. Mr. Bretz noted that the survey displayed ""some signs of softening, particularly in the export order growth rate."" But he added that ""the continued healthy level of new orders, combined with a solid downtrend in the inflation rate, virtually assures a strong fourth quarter."""

0,"The past two months have been punishing ones for investors in ""high yield,"" or junk-bond, funds.After a few years in which these funds outstripped most other types of bond funds, they have recently fallen hard, in step with the stock market. Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain.The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds. ""Sometimes these securities trade with the general bond market and sometimes they trade with the stock market,"" says Earl McEvoy, manager of Vanguard Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Fund. Lately, it's been much closer to the stock market.But ""too often,"" Mr. McEvoy says, investors assume a high-yield fund is simply that -- ""just another bond fund with a higher yield."" In a period like the past several weeks -- when stock prices tumbled but government-bond prices rose -- he says investors may assume mistakenly that their junk-bond funds are comfortably holding their ground.That certainly hasn't been the case. Since the stock-market peak on July 17, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s high-yield fund index has posted a negative 9.0% return. That's not as bad as the performance of most stock funds, such as the 15.7% decline for the Lipper Growth Fund Index. But it is sharply worse than the positive 3.1% return on a Lipper index of government-bond funds and a positive 2.0% return on its index of funds holding high-quality (A-rated) corporate bonds."
1,"Much of the financial world hangs on Janet Yellen's every word, looking for policy portents in language that is crafted to be circumspect about the central bank's plans. A more useful place to look for guidance on regulation of the financial system is Daniel Tarullo, a Federal Reserve Board governor and its point man for banking reform. Mr. Tarullo gave a speech in Chicago on May 8 that was as unsettling as it was, by the Fed's inscrutable standards, unguarded.Addressing the Chicago Fed Bank Structure Conference, Mr. Tarullo proposed that the central bank must ""broaden the perimeter of prudential regulation, both to certain nonbank financial institutions and to certain activities by all financial actors."" This expansion of regulatory authority would take the Fed far beyond the current power it exercises thanks to the Dodd-Frank law passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crises. The casualties of such an expansion could include small- and medium-size banks.Under Dodd-Frank, ultimate financial regulatory power resides with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, a council of 10 regulators chaired by the Treasury and which includes the Fed chairman. The FSOC can designate asset managers, mutual funds, hedge funds, or even broker-dealers as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, a classification that puts an institution under the Fed's regulatory authority. The council has already designated the large insurers AIG and Prudential as SIFIs, and it has many more nonbank financial companies in its sights.The council's moves are part of a larger blueprint that Mr. Tarullo has now laid out. In the Chicago speech, he proposed ditching complex Basel III capital and liquidity regulations and reducing regulations on small banks. The new system he outlined would use simpler, Basel I capital charges for small banks, on grounds that the failure of these banks would pose no threat to financial stability. Larger regional banks would require slightly elevated regulatory standards, but nothing too complex.Once a bank joins a ""club"" of the 80 largest institutions, however, the Federal Reserve should be its regulator, Mr. Tarullo said, and regulation should focus on annual stress tests. The very largest institutions, U.S. global banks and nonbank SIFIs, would receive the most intrusive Fed oversight and be required to satisfy the full range of new international macroprudential rules."
0,"Every part of the U.S. economy - consumer spending, business investment, housing, government purchases, even exports - declined in the first three months of 1991, confirming the country's slide into its first recession since 1982, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.The department said the gross national product, the country's output of goods and services, fell at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter after adjustment for inflation. The drop followed a decline at the rate of 1.6 percent in the final three months of last year.The extended fall in economic activity left economists divided yesterday on how long the downturn might last.Many forecasters, including those in the Bush administration, expect the recession to hit bottom sometime during the current quarter, but some other economists saw details of yesterday's report - particularly a large decline in business spending on new plants and equipment - as an indication that the recovery will not begin until later.""It was a broadly based decline in economic activity,"" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, ""and it looks as though there will be another decline in the second quarter."""
0,"In recent months, Americans have heard reports out of Washington and in the media that the economy is looking up -- that recovery from the Great Recession is gathering steam. If only it were true. The longest and worst recession since the end of World War II has been marked by the weakest recovery from any U.S. recession in that same period.The jobless nature of the recovery is particularly unsettling. In June, the government's Household Survey reported that since the start of the year, the number of people with jobs increased by 753,000 -- but there are jobs and then there are ""jobs."" No fewer than 557,000 of these positions were only part-time. The survey also reported that in June full-time jobs declined by 240,000, while part-time jobs soared by 360,000 and have now reached an all-time high of 28,059,000 -- three million more part-time positions than when the recession began at the end of 2007.That's just for starters. The survey includes part-time workers who want full-time work but can't get it, as well as those who want to work but have stopped looking. That puts the real unemployment rate for June at 14.3%, up from 13.8% in May.The 7.6% unemployment figure so common in headlines these days is utterly misleading. An estimated 22 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed; they are virtually invisible and mostly excluded from unemployment calculations that garner headlines.At this stage of an expansion you would expect the number of part-time jobs to be declining, as companies would be doing more full-time hiring. Not this time. In the long misery of this post-recession period, we have an extraordinary situation: Americans by the millions are in part-time work because there are no other employment opportunities as businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-time, temporary and seasonal employees."

0,"WASHINGTON -- The February decline in the unemployment rate masks continuing problems among the nation's manufacturers.The civilian unemployment rate dropped to 7.3% of the work force last month from 7.4% in January, the Labor Department said. But it took a large rise in services employment to offset substantial declines in manufacturing and construction employment, according to the department's survey of business payrolls. The average hours of factory workers also dropped, to 40.0 a week from 40.6. Together, the numbers suggest industrial production actually fell in the month.Analysts believe some of the decline in manufacturing and construction may have been tied to harsh weather during February. But the numbers also seem to suggest that manufacturers have yet to fully recover from the sluggish growth that occurred in last year's third quarter.""The decline in manufacturing reflects the overbuilding of inventories in late 1984 and increased import penetration as a result of the rapid escalation of the dollar,"" said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.Companies should be able to work off excess inventories in the next month or two. But the problems that manufacturers face as a result of the strong dollar can be expected to continue throughout the year. A strong dollar increases imports by lowering the prices of foreign products, while making U.S. products more costly for overseas buyers."

The moves have helped some borrowers who have seen interest rates on their credit cards and home-equity lines of credit fall. Interest rates on many fixed-rate mortgages also have dropped amid a decline in Treasury yields as investors sought out safe investments.But rates remain stubbornly high on other loans, including student debt and many adjustable-rate loans made to the same type of subprime borrowers whose troubles are now reverberating throughout the global financial system. These rates remain high because many of these loans are tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and not to more conventional interest-rate benchmarks such as Treasurys or banks' prime rate.Libor, which is an interest rate banks charge on loans to each other, normally tracks the federal-funds rate closely. But continuing worries over the credit crisis have kept Libor unusually high -- partly because banks are reluctant to lend to one another -- even as other short-term interest rates have fallen in recent months. The U.S. dollar three-month Libor yesterday was 5.11%, down from 5.36% in late June. Over the same period, three-month Treasury bill yields have fallen much more steeply, to 2.95% from 4.8%. ""The Libor spread is screaming that there is a big, big stress point in the banking system,"" says James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, a market-research firm in Chicago.Borrowers may need to read the fine print of their loan agreement or contact their lender to know what benchmark their loan is tied to. The biggest impact is likely to be felt among borrowers with ARMs that are about to reset. ""If you have a Libor-indexed ARM and you're facing a reset, that's going to be very disadvantageous because of the divergence between the Libor and Treasury yields,"" says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com."

0,"If you're starting to sniff recession in the air, remember that this editorial is the third in a series.It seems time, since over the past two weeks the markets have been giving off the symptoms of a stall. The stock market sidestepped into the new year and promptly fell about 250 points as of Friday's close. Markets reacted coldly last Tuesday to a 40-year bond offering by the government's S&L bailout agency. Gold began the year at about $400 and in three weeks is up to $420. Simultaneously, the White House has turned a bit cranky over the Fed's handling of monetary policy.Most economists still expect merely a slowdown in growth, but the sense that something's wrong is palpable. What we've witnessed is entirely consistent with what we predicted in our two ""Mitchell Recession"" editorials in November. The market, and through it the general economy, is being whipsawed by Congress's handling of the capital-gains issue. We first noted back on November 7 that Senator Mitchell was congratulating himself for killing the Bush capital-gains proposal, and wondered whether he'd take credit later if the economy stalled. On November 30, with the market at 2688 we wrote:""The stock market, after rising while a capital-gains cut gained political momentum, collapsed 190 points when Mr. Mitchell stopped it, and now remains at about the August 1 level. Everyone is therefore looking for the Fed to ease monetary policy.""The market rallied a bit in December; tax advisers suggested that normal year-end profit-taking be pushed into 1990, because their consensus among people who mattered -- George Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Dan Rostenkowski was that a capital-gains cut in 1990 was baked in the cake."

0,"The pending farm bill provides no parity for the poor. Faced with the need to cut the federal deficit and deal with falling farm income, Congress is pursuing the easiest and least defensible solution. It's asking American consumers to pay more for food, and the burden will fall disproportionately on the poor and hungry. In 1981 and 1982, Congress cut over $3 billion from food assistance programs. Now it is voting to raise supermarket prices for milk, cheese, meat and bread.For almost 50 years the federal government has attempted to increase farm income through a combination of programs that limit production and drive food prices up or that make direct payments to farmers when farm prices fall below a certain level. Direct payments tend to have less impact on retail food prices, but they can cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Therefore, it isn't surprising that, in a time of huge budget deficits, a growing farm crisis and relatively stable food prices. Congress is tempted to adopt a farm program that shifts costs from the citizen as taxpayer to the citizen as consumer.The House has already succumbed. It approved a dairy diversion program that will raise millc and cheese prices by $10 billion over the next four years and a sugar program that will cost consumers $140 million to $160 million a year. It is about to vote on a program of mandatory production controls on feed grains and wheat that would raise meat and bakery product prices by $15 billion over a four-year period and could raise the consumer price index for food by 1 percent a year.Production-control advocates argue that food prices have been quite stable over the past few years, that Americans spend less of their disposable income for food than consumers in other developed nations and that the anticipated food-price increases generated by the farm bill are a reasonable trade-off for preserving the family farm.They aren't all wrong. Food prices went up 4 percent last year, and this year's increase is expected to be about the same. Our food prices are generally lower than those in other countries. I believe urban America has a stake in maintaining a healthy farm economy."

0,"President Obama, in speech after speech, proudly makes the following point: Although we inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, we have generated net new jobs every month, and while we need to do more, we are going in the right direction.Of course, recoveries always go in the right direction--that is, things get better over time. But merely going in the right direction is an incredibly low performance standard. Moreover, since deep recessions are generally followed by more robust recoveries, this should have been one of the strongest recoveries ever.So what went wrong? All the available Keynesian levers for achieving economic growth have been pulled, yet the recovery is one of the weakest since World War II. The problem lies with the way the ""stimulus"" was carried out, the uncertainty of looming higher taxes, and the antibusiness rhetoric and regulatory strong-arming of this administration.First, exactly how weak has this recovery been? The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis tracks economic performance for each recovery and compares gross-domestic-product growth and job growth, the two most important indicators of economic performance. Over the past 60 years, there have been 11 recessions and 11 recoveries.Sadly, this recovery is near the bottom of all 11. Cumulative nonfarm job growth is just 1.9% 34 months into recovery, the ninth-worst performance and well below the average job growth of 6.5%. Cumulative GDP growth is just 6.8% 11 quarters into this recovery, less than half the average (15.2%) and the worst of all 11."
1,"WASHINGTON -- Overall consumer prices didn't increase at all in January, according to the Labor Department, some thing that hasn't happened in more than four years.Analysts said the figures show, yet again, that inflation is well under control despite a noticeably improving economy.Last month's steady prices followed a moderate increase in December, when prices were 0.2% above November's. The bitterly cold weather didn't damage crops enough to force up prices, as the cost of food declined last month. Clothing, trans portation and energy prices declined as well, while housing prices moderated. Medical-care and entertainment prices both rose 0.3%, the same as they did in December. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was up only 0.1%, com pared with a 0.2% rise in December.January's consumer price report marks the first in which the Labor Department has used new seasonal adjustments to help diminish the report's tendency to show larger price increases at the beginning of the year and smaller ones at the end.For that reason, analysts were unsure how much credence to put into the January price figures. ""I don't believe the headline should read 'inflation is dead,' but if I saw no change at all in February and March, I would consider it a real trend,"" said Kathryn Kobe, economist for Joel Popkin & Co. in Washington."

1,"WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing.Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997.The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2% last month from 8.9% a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot: the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9% last month, down from 2.1% a year earlier. (The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them.)The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7% of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to $12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8%, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January. Anecdotal evidence -- such as disappointing profit reports and job cuts at blue-chip companies -- has added to the perception of softening. Policymakers have assumed some easing from last year's torrid growth rate was imminent. That was a big reason the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week."

""I don't think the Texas economy is going to improve a lot in the near term,"" he said, although ""the psychology is so much better.""Some analysts say the run-up in oil prices actually could prove detrimental to energy-state economies and therefore to banks in the region. Since the last boom-bust cycle in the oil industry, many of those economies have diversified into industries more closely linked to the general U.S. economy. Thus, the reasoning goes, if higher energy costs cause a recession in the rest of the U.S., states such as Texas would suffer too.According to Sandra J. Flannigan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., Baltimore, oil and gas accounted for only 15% of Texas's economic output in 1989, compared with a peak of 27% in 1981.Energy companies, worried that prices could sink again as fast as they rose, are being much more cautious about new investments and exploration this time. And because their extra income isn't being spread around much yet, employment, loan growth and demand for real estate remained depressed in the third quarter, bankers and analysts say."

The drop in housing starts isn't the start of a recurring recession, but rather a temporary plateau, said Martin Regalia, chief economist with the National Council of Community Bankers.

1,"WASHINGTON -- A trade deficit wider than expected and strong retail sales signaled that the economy remains on a solid upward trajectory but prompted concerns in the markets that inflation is heating up.The trade gap widened 3.6% to a record $48.3 billion in April, from March's $46.6 billion, according to the Commerce Department. The deficit reflected a decline in exports of $1.5 billion, while imports remained largely flat. The drop covered a broad range of exports, but a number of analysts dismissed it as a statistical aberration.""Over the last year, exports were up 10%; over the last three months, exports rose almost 20% at an annual rate,"" says John Ryding, chief U.S. economist for the investment bank Bear Stearns. ""The trend is unambiguously higher."" The National Association of Manufacturers also dismissed the decline as ""a one-time correction.""The widening trade deficit could put downward pressure on the dollar as investors lose confidence in the ability of the U.S. to repay its debts, boosting the prices of imports higher than they otherwise would be. But the deficit can also be a signal of economic strength. That is because the U.S. is growing more rapidly than other industrialized nations and absorbing more imports than its trading partners.Retail sales, which grew at a 1.2% pace in May, compared with a 0.6% drop in April, was another signal of a strengthening U.S. economy. May's growth drew on a healthier job market and aggressive discounting at car dealerships looking to counter higher gasoline prices. Light- vehicle sales among the Big Three U.S. auto makers rose 14.6% in May compared with the month before, the National Automobile Dealers Association said."

Private analysts had expected the June deficit to be somewhat narrower than May's, based on earlier economic reports. Imports in June slowed to a seasonally adjusted $75.79 billion from $76.29 billion in May, but exports also fell, to $64.48 billion from $65.24 billion.""This caught us a little bit by surprise. It was a little bit worse than expected,"" said Brian Horrigan, senior economist at Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston. He added that the trade deficit would have been wider, had it not been for a decline in crude-oil prices in June.For the first half, the trade deficit in goods and services mushroomed to $63.80 billion from $49.94 billion in the year-earlier period.Administration officials put the best gloss on the figures, insisting that the important development was the surge in export growth in the first half.

0,"High interest rates are the stick that drove Congress and the White House to negotiate all spring over the budget and that may yet push Congress to take some action to reduce the upcoming deficit.The theory is that lower prospective deficits will reduce pressure on the financial markets, reduce fear of future inflation, and for both reasons bring a reduction in interest rates that will let the economy off the floor of recession.All sides agree that high interest rates are a leading cause of the economy's problems. But there is lively disagreement about the rest of the equation: just what is keeping rates high now, and how best to bring them down without harming the economy in other ways.President Reagan has himself been afflicted by this split in opinion. Thus he has said that the likely deficits over the next several years are keeping rates high, in part because they are raising inflationary expectations and leaving investors unwilling to lend except at extremely high rates. But he has also taken a contrary view and, citing cases in the Midwest where local banks have cut their rates, has argued that interest rates should come down because the inflation rate has come down so rquch in recent months.There are several lines of argument against the interest rate theory on which the budget negotiators have been operating."

The disclosure by the Congressional Budget Office of new projections showing the federal deficit rising to $198 billion in 1989 also caused big ripples across the Atlantic.The Financial Times of London gave its account of the CBO's revised projection the lead position on its front page. Since most U.S. newspapers did not give the story such treatment, why does it attract this attention in Europe?Here this new projection looks like a body blow to the monetary strategy that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III has been pursuing for the past six months. Baker has been skillfully buying time, waiting for the expected improvement in the trade and budget deficits to blunt protectionist pressures at home.The sense of the deficits turning around was also supposed to encourage Japan and West Germany to take increasingly larger steps to lead international growth and help out the U.S. economy.Baker had relied heavily on the CBO's original prediction that the deficit would come down to $161 billion by 1989.

1,"ONE OF the great feats of social engineering in the last 25 years has been a huge increase in the standard of living of the elderly. Social Security and Medicare have been the means. The elderly had a poverty rate of 25 percent in the late 1960s. It is half that now, and lower than the rate for the society as a whole, thanks mainly to increased Social Security benefits. In addition, thanks to Medicare, the elderly are now the group in society with the most comprehensive health insurance.The problem with these programs is not the benefits they confer, but the cost. They have come to dominate, if not the government itself, most certainly its budget. Aiding the elderly is now the main thing that the federal government does; such aid accounts for fully half the budget for other than interest on the debt and defense. The share can only rise as the baby boomers retire in the years ahead - but the money to support such an expansion is not in sight.The taxes presently in place won't cover projected Social Security costs when the boomers retire early in the next century. The Medicare trust fund will be exhausted even earlier. To protect the long-term integrity of both, Congress will sooner or later have to raise taxes or cut costs; if costs, it ought to begin a gradual process now.The trust funds are one source of pressure on the elder-programs; the other is the budget deficit. The president and Congress took a welcome step toward reducing it last year; they need to do more. A favorite target of budget-cutters is the spending category called entitlements. Their semi-automatic growth each year is taken as proof of the indiscipline the budget-cutters mean to cure. Which is fine, but it, too, is a euphemism. Entitlements turn out to be 60 percent aid to the elderly by another name. Congress keeps threatening to impose entitlement caps in the abstract, and now there is also an entitlements commission. But entitlement-cutting is mainly a way of discussing in general and in code a subject that the politicians would do better to discuss directly.Thus a leading budget-cutting proposal now making the rounds is to cut the cost of entitlements across the board by means-testing them. Among the proponents is the budget-balancing group called the Concord Coalition. The idea is that a hard-pressed government has no business paying benefits (or asking middle-income taxpayers to finance benefits) for people above certain income cutoffs. For recipients with incomes above, say, $40,000 a year, entitlements (including Social Security benefits and the insurance value of Medicare) would be progressively reduced, though never wiped out entirely."

0,"WASHINGTON -- The leak rumors that helped send stock and bond prices plunging are the latest in a series riling the markets recently, only months after the Commerce Department tightened its control over sensitive data.Yesterday's turmoil came partly in response to some bond and financial futures markets trading based on rumored leaks of information that the Commerce Department's retail sales report would show a 2.5% increase for August and that the Labor Department's producer price index for August would register a 0.5% rise. If true, the figures, particularly the retail sales number, would suggest that the economy is growing more briskly than many forecasters expected.Traders pay close attention to these economic reports, and when they differ from what was expected it can lead to turmoil in the market.While leak rumors aren't unusual, their pace seems to have stepped up in the wake of two recent instances when rumors proved to be on target. Traders, asserting they had received leaked figures, accurately predicted last month that the Commerce Department's revised figures for second-quarter gross national product would show a 0.6% rise at an inflation-adjusted annual rate and that the agency's index of leading indicators would jump 1.1% for July.Both reports differed significantly from market expectations."

1,"In the past year, a group of individuals interested in investment banking and the stock market, with the aid of Washington legal advisers, has been quietly pushing a proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains.A Senate finance subcommittee already has held little-publicized hearings on the proposal, and it is now being promoted before the House Ways and Means Committee as a tax reform.The essence of this proposal is that the proportion of a capital gain included in taxable income which now is only 50 per cent, of the gain should he reduced still further. The proposed reduction would be in steps of 2 per cent a year for each year the asset is hold, up to 15 years. Thus, for stock held for 15 years, only 20 per cent of the gain on its sale would be taxable.For the wealthiest individuals, those in the 70 per cent lop tax bracket, this proposal would thus reduce their tax on the gain from 35 per cent (70 per cent of 50 per cent of the gain) to only 14 per cent (70 per cent of 20 per cent of the gain). Ironically, 14 per cent is also precisely the rate of tax applicable to the wages of the poorest taxpayers in the country.Any reduction in the capital gains tax on the sale of stock or other capital assets will primarily benefit high-income families. Recent statistics of income indicate that individuals and families with incomes above $25,000 about 3 per cent of all lax returns account for around 55 per cent of all capital gains. Taxpayers with more than $100,000 of income about 0.1 per cent of all returns receive about 30 per cent of all capital gains."

0,"WASHINGTON -- The deteriorating U.S. trade balance, which showed a record deficit of $69.39 billion in 1983, represents a problem for every industry that exports its products or faces heavy competition from imports.December's merchandise trade deficit, the Commerce Department said, narrowed to $6.3 billion from November's $7.4 billion, largely because of a decline in oil imports. But Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he expected the 1984 deficit to widen further, with imports exceeding exports by perhaps $100 billion.The effect of these trade woes has been widespread, even extending to industries where the U.S. traditionally has had an edge over foreign competitors -- such as telecommunications and machinery. David Ernst, vice president of Evans Economics here, says the deficit cost the U.S. 1.5 million jobs in 1983.The main reason the deficit is so large, most economists agree, is the high value of the dollar, which has risen some 30% against other major currencies since 1980. That makes U.S. exports more expensive overseas and foreign goods cheaper in the U.S. As a result, ""American firms have a 30% cost disadvantage in world markets,"" complains Jack Albertine, who heads a trade association of medium-size, fast-growth companies called the American Business Conference.The dollar's high value results primarily from high inflation-adjusted interest rates, which attract foreign savings to this country, according to the conventional analysis. High interest rates, in turn, are caused partly by the government's mammoth budget deficits."

1,"One of the most buzzed about figures at the annual meetings of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia this weekend was Alvin Hansen, an economist who has been dead for nearly 40 years.Mr. Hansen posited in December 1938 that the U.S. was stuck in a period of profoundly slow economic growth he called secular stagnation, driven by slowing population growth and insufficient technological progress. He turned out to be wrong, but top U.S. economists are now hotly debating whether his ideas apply today, and if so what to do about it.The self-appointed heir to Mr. Hansen's theory is Lawrence Summers, the former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who points to nagging sluggish U.S. growth since the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 and proposes more aggressive government spending.Mr. Summers first raised the secular stagnation idea in November and pressed his argument during three days of meetings this past weekend.""Expansionary fiscal policy is the right primary response to our current woes, one that offers more potential than is generally imagined,"" Mr. Summers said on a panel at the conference Saturday."

In petitions, U.S. furniture manufacturers have asserted that they have been unfairly harmed by a surge of such goods.The furniture spat comes amid continuing signs that trade may intensify as a political issue in the months before next year's presidential election in the United States. On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit climbed in October to a record high of $41.8 billion while running at an annual rate of more than $490 billion -- far larger than last year's record trade deficit of $418 billion.At the center of the tension sits China, whose trade surplus with the United States is expected to swell beyond $120 billion for the year.

0,"In recent months, one overriding debate has raged within the world- wide financial community. How can long-term U.S. interest rates be so low? And how can so many economists have been so wrong on their interest rate forecasts? No less a figure than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, famously described this question as a ""conundrum"" in congressional testimony earlier this year.It is stunning for the head of our central bank to describe himself as mystified by the behavior of overall rates. But he has plenty of company. This observer cannot recall a bigger disconnect between conventional wisdom and market reality on such a central issue. Indeed, today, yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen to the astonishingly low levels of 4.1% and 4.4% respectively. Both are lower than the average annual yield for these securities over the last 25 years. These low rates persist even in the face of powerful factors which, in historical terms, should drive them up, including monetary policy itself, a strong U.S. economic growth outlook and the increasingly large size of our current account deficit. This contradiction is, in essence, the conundrum.Three alternative schools of thought have emerged to explain it. One is that the bond market has overshot. A second is that the growth outlook is actually weaker than the consensus forecast, and the bond market is discounting such slower growth before it manifests itself. But the right answer involves excess global liquidity which, for the moment, has nowhere else to go but into dollar-denominated fixed- income assets like U.S. Treasury securities.---Before we proceed, let's review the conundrum itself in detail. Chairman Greenspan's precise comment referred to the unprecedented behavior of longer-term interest rates in light of recent monetary policy. He noted that the Federal Reserve Board has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight times since June, 2004. Mr. Greenspan emphasized that past increases in the shortest-term rates have always pushed up long- term rates. But not this time."

0,"NEW YORK -- It's time to call a halt to the bond market's infatuation with the monthly employment data and look further afield for new ways to detect wage inflation.That's the argument advanced by growing numbers of economists and market participants, as Americans continue to find jobs at a steady clip and the unemployment rate drops sharply. Weary of the bond-market gyrations touched off by each monthly employment report, they have embarked on a quest for new clues about inflation. Some are even putting their faith in anecdotal evidence instead of the sometimes confounding signals from the statistical data.""The employment numbers are becoming increasingly less relevant as the numbers of people finding jobs has grown,"" argues Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. ""Frankly, there aren't that many people left to hire. . . . A gain of 300,000 in today's labor market is the equivalent of what would have been [a] massive gain of 700,000 jobs four years ago.""The reason, Ms. Kimelman says, is that as the rate at which Americans find new jobs has leveled off at around 230,000 a month, the unemployment rate continues to fall and average hourly earnings continue to climb. Indeed, Friday's report showed that average hourly earnings rose six cents in August to $11.87, the highest level seen since December 1990, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%. Those factors helped cap the Treasury market's ""relief"" rally, touched off when traders saw that the overall job growth was within expected bounds.""The fixation on the `big' overall number of new jobs isn't sane,"" says one trader, disgruntled after a day of fielding more calls than he says he gets in an average week, all from clients seeking insight into a single figure."

Some analysts say the Fed may even loosen its credit grip and push down interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy.Prices of some actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds surged more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. Most short-term interest rates fell.The rally erased the sharp declines in bond prices registered Monday when the markets were jolted by the collapse of a small securities firm.

That could reflect retailer stockpiling of imported goods or the increased difficulty of selling imports at higher prices. But many economists fear that the buildup comes from slowing consumer spending and that recession and layoffs will follow.Confusing the picture is the healthy level of manufacturing inventories. A lower dollar is boosting exports and helping the industrial sector, says Gregory Gieber of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. He thinks this will ""offset the weakness of the consumer sector.""

1,"Dow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- The dollar suffered a broad-based setback after signs that inflationary pressures remain modest curtailed hopes that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to raise interest rates.The dollar's selloff was sparked by the release of a May consumer- price index that came mostly in line with expectations. While the overall CPI registered the biggest monthly jump in 31/2 years, rising 0.6%, the more closely watched core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, edged up 0.2%. Expectations were for a 0.5% gain in the headline number, with a 0.2% rise in core prices.Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan threw even more cold water on speculation that U.S. rates were headed sharply higher when he played down the risk of inflation. The Fed chief, testifying in front of the Senate Banking Committee on his nomination to a fifth term as chairman, said the central bank's ""general view is that inflationary pressures are not likely to be a serious concern in the period ahead.""Thus, Mr. Greenspan said, he still expects to be able to lift interest rates at a ""measured"" pace this year, though he reaffirmed that the Fed is prepared to raise rates more aggressively if necessary."

0,"JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wasn't expecting he would have to make another speech like the one he will deliver here Friday.A few months ago, the Fed seemed to be on cruise control as the economy healed. Many officials at the central bank hoped they were done with launching complicated programs to spur a sluggish economy. But Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, once again disappointed by slow growth and small employment gains this year, are formulating another dose of monetary stimulus to be considered at their next policy meeting in mid-September.So when the chairman speaks Friday morning at the central bank's annual retreat here, he must once again address whether there is more the Fed can do to get the economy going and whether it is worth taking chances on controversial new programs. All along he has argued these efforts are worth it and appears likely to stick to that line in his speech.Beyond big issues of the moment -- such as whether the Fed will launch a new bond-buying program -- a broader question looms in Jackson Hole about Mr. Bernanke's legacy. Long after his term as chairman ends in 17 months, will he be remembered as the Fed chief who did too little to combat high unemployment or the one who did too much and unleashed inflation and financial instability with the actions he took? Critics make both arguments.How Mr. Bernanke acts now depends in part on which he sees as the stronger critique. As an academic before joining the Fed, Mr. Bernanke often criticized central bankers for dealing too passively with financial crises and economic malaise. As Fed chief, he has confronted many limitations to the policies he controls."

Allowing more homeowners to take advantage of low interest rates to reduce their monthly payments could both lower the risk of future defaults and boost the weak U.S. economic recovery."

""What the market has been telling us is that most people have no conviction and plenty of cash. It's been a trader's market, and it's going to remain a trader's market until we get some internal or external stimulus.""The best news the market could get, Mr. Metz says, would be more evidence that the Federal Reserve's credit-tightening moves are beginning to slow the economy. Last week's declines in the index of leading economic indicators and in home sales were encouraging from this point of view, he says, as was Friday's announcement of a relatively modest rise in non-farm payrolls in August.That news sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a giddy rise of more than 50 points.

0,"The Federal Reserve, seeing few signs of a financial crisis in Fri-day's big stock market drop, yesterday added $2 billion in cash to the banking system in such a restrained way that it convinced most analysts not to look for a sharp drop in interest rates.Some analysts said they thought the stock market drop likely would cause the Fed to lower the federal funds rate the key interest rate financial institutions charge one another for overnight loans from about 9 percent to 8.75 percent or a bit less.But Federal Reserve officials, like their counterparts elsewhere in government, are waiting to see whether the market decline re- i sumes. Since the economy is much i less buoyant now than it was prior 1 to the stock market crash in October 1987, any depressing impact from falling stock prices on consumer spending or business investment could virtually eliminate growth.Over the weekend, unidentified senior Federal Reserve officials said the central bank would supply cash to the banking system to reassure investors adequate credit would be available if loans were needed as a result of falling stock prices.But other Fed officials were uncomfortable with the published comments, arguing that they all but forced the central bank to add cash to the banking system yesterday even if it was not needed.

The developments ""may be an early indication"" that the economy's contraction is slowing and it will stabilize later this year, he said.After Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, Mr. Kohn is the most influential Fed board member. His comments, coming just before next week's Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting, suggest that the view among Fed officials has improved in recent weeks.Mr. Kohn, in a speech earlier this month, had said, ""We are not out of the woods yet,"" a sign of the reluctance of officials to read too much into glimmers of improvement.With the outlook still uncertain, and the economy burdened by considerable slack, it's too early for the Fed to begin considering pulling back its rescue programs for the U.S. economy.

1,"Washington -- Contrary to popular belief, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is capable of speaking clearly. A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing.""A striking feature"" of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, ""has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business.""Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve ""pricing power"" in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare ""service"" providers without global competition: universities that raise tuition; hospitals jacking up fees; or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000.But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs ""the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy.""Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming. When will the discounting, rebating and price-cutting reverse course? What happens if industries shutter excess factories around the world or if inventories are trimmed? What happens to prices if industries become more concentrated oligopolies?"

Maybe it's time to worry about what will happen if it doesn't.Economic growth has been sluggish for much of the past year, thanks largely to the housing downturn. Consumers have kept on spending, and they have helped to keep the economy on an even keel. Economic output grew at an annual rate of just 0.6% in the first quarter. Had it not been for a 4.4% rate of increase in consumer outlays, the economy likely would have contracted."
1,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates another notch yesterday, continuing its efforts to bolster a recessionary economy.The action is expected to bring the key federal funds interest rate down to about 6 3/4% from 7% in recent weeks. Other short-term interest rates are likely to decline accordingly.The reduction comes barely three weeks after the Fed's last easing move and illustrates the central bank's growing concern about the economy. In addition, the action follows the government's takeover Sunday of the Bank of New England, which has heightened fears that a weak economy could lead to financial crisis.""We're in a recession, and as long as we're in a recession, the Federal Reserve will be in an easing mode,"" says Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co.Many economists believe the Fed will have to cut interest rates further to get the economy growing again. But they caution that if the U.S. goes to war against Iraq, any further easing moves by the Fed could be put on hold."

She is the character in Rodgers' and Hammerstein's ""Oklahoma"" who sings of herself: I'm just a girl who can't say no.The inability of the Democrats to say no to wonderful-sounding, extravagant schemes is probably the single biggest reason they have lost four of the five presidential races since Lyndon Johnson left the White House. Johnson in his long congressional career and in his five years as president made a high art of public benefaction.From the gift of government-subsidized electricity to his Hill Country neighbors at the start of his career, to Medicare and Model Cities in the high-flying Great Society days at the end, he practiced generosity of unparalleled scale with the taxpayers' money. His stump speeches in the 1964 campaign promised that Washington would provide help for ""Molly and the babies,"" down to and specifically including ""a house for the family and pictures on the walls.""Appreciative as they were of those benefits, the voters have decided in every presidential election but one since 1968 that enough is enough. Though they regularly tell pollsters they think the Democrats are more sympathetic to working people and their problems and have given those Democrats a near-permanent lease on Congress, they have thought it prudent to keep a check on extravagance by having the GOP control the White House.This is a gut-level, instinctive, extraconstitutional addition to the many other ""checks and balances"" in our system of government. It's a psychological comfort to a citizenry that covets the public-financed programs Democrats dangle, but has been burned badly by inflation the past two times the Democrats had the keys to the White House as well as Congress in their hands."

0,"Many economists and economic scribes have arrived at a particular gloomy paradigm to describe the current U.S. economy. This consensus is surprising because the paradigm itself is seriously flawed.The paradigm consists of four propositions: First, government deficits are responsible for high interest rates; second, high interest rates are responsible for the ""overvalued"" dollar; third, the overvalued dollar is responsible for the huge increase in the U.S. trade deficit; and, finally, the trade deficit is just plain bad.The validity of the propositions is limited and decreases rapidly as one moves down the list.Consider the first proposition. As Treasury Secretary Donald Regan keeps reminding us, empirical analysis shows no statistically significant historical relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. Over the past three years, while the deficit has more than tripled, the prime rate -- the base interest rate that commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers with the best credit ratings -- has fallen to 11% from 18.9%. Adjusting interest rates for inflation to approximate the ""real"" rate of interest doesn't change the picture very much: During the same period the real rate fell to 7% from 10%, notwithstanding the tripled deficit.Nevertheless, there is common-sense validity to the notion that larger government borrowing will, other things being equal, exert upward pressure on rates. (However, one point that's usually neglected by those who advance this argument is that efforts to reduce the deficit by increasing taxes may also exert upward pressure on interest rates because increased taxes will result in decreased private savings, rather than simply in reduced private spending.)"

But it is $46 billion more than last year's record shortfall, with even more red ink possible, the nonpartisan agency reported: The expected total 10-year deficit would climb from $2.3 trillion to $3.6 trillion if President Bush is able to extend the tax cuts he enacted. They are currently set to expire in 2011.""This is a fiscal situation in which we cannot rely on economic growth to cause deficits to disappear,"" warned CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economist for the Bush White House. ""The budgetary outlook will be dictated by policy choices.""About half of the projected 10-year deficit is based on an assumption that conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan will continue. The CBO policy requires that deficit projections be based on current conditions.The budget office expects that the total federal debt held by the public -- the amount borrowed through the sale of Treasury bonds to finance overspending -- will balloon 58 percent over the next decade, from $4.3 trillion this year to nearly $6.8 trillion in 2014."

Until recently, many investors had feared that vigorous economic activity and rapid money growth would prompt the Fed to tighten its credit hold and drive up interest rates.The Commerce Department yesterday estimated that the economy is growing at only a 2.1% annual rate this quarter, down from a 4.3% clip in last year's fourth quarter. The department's preliminary, or ""flash,"" estimate was well below the rate of about 4% that many analysts had been expecting.Prices of some Treasury bonds rose almost 3/4 of a point, or nearly $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.

And this will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to further increase interest rates to shore up the currency. The dollar traded late yesterday at 1.6535 marks, up from 1.6368 the day before, and at 101.85 yen, up from 101.00.In a clear and deliberate departure from past rhetoric, which described intervention as a response to ""disorderly"" markets and ""volatility,"" Mr. Bentsen said yesterday's moves ""reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals."" Trying to dispel the notion that the U.S. wants to depreciate its currency to make its exports more attractive and to put pressure on Japan to agree to trade concessions, Mr. Bentsen said: ""This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency.""Administration officials say that the markets have badly misread their dollar policy. The intervention is an effort to ""counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar,"" a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar. That view gained credence earlier this year when the Treasury failed to act to brake the dollar when it fell sharply against the yen."

Furthermore, they say investor jitters over the safety of the banking system, which have contributed to the recent spurt in some key rates, aren't likely to fade any time soon.""There isn't any evidence of a need to move policy,"" said Alan Greenspan, chairman of Townsend-Greenspan & Co., an economic-consulting firm.

1,"Strong income gains and unseasonably warm weather prompted consumers to spend more money than usual in January. Along with data showing manufacturing activity expanded in February, that suggests the economy is on track for robust first-quarter growth.Personal income of Americans increased 0.7% in January, the biggest jump since September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.Consumer spending is ""strengthening sharply in the first quarter"" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is ""recovering after the post-hurricane lull"" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements. Excluding these special factors, personal income increased 0.4% in January, BEA says."

Terms of the securities are not usually available until the sale period begins.Northrop Grumman said Friday that its Electronic Systems division is laying off about 230 employees at its operations in Maryland, Alabama, New York and Connecticut. About 215 of the layoffs would occur at the division's plants in Linthicum, Annapolis and Sykesville, the Baltimore Sun reported. Some of the Annapolis cuts, its Oceanic and Naval Systems business unit, are because of delays in financing on projects for the Defense Department, said Northrop Grumman, which is based in El Segundo, Calif. Northrop Grumman is Maryland's largest manufacturing employer. Its Electronic Systems division employs 9,000 people at operations in Linthicum, Annapolis, Sykesville, Belcamp, Hagerstown, Gaithersburg and Lanham."

But because overall volume also soared on the exchange, the percentage figure of 11.3% wasn't a record; indeed, it represented a decline from last year's 11.6%. (The record was 11.9% in 1993.)The Big Board has released program-trading data since mid-1988, in response to an outcry over the multistock trading activity and its role in the 1987 stock-market crash. Program trading is defined as the buying or selling of a group of at least 15 different stocks valued at a total of $1 million or more.The five most active program-trading firms in 1995 through the end of September, the latest numbers available, were Morgan Stanley Group Inc.; First Options; the U.S. unit of Japan's Nomura Securities; CS First Boston, a unit of CS Holding; and Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers unit.The best-known form of program trading is index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell baskets of stocks with offsetting trades of futures and options.

The same uncertainty affected businesses in their spending plans.""The fundamental restraint on the economy is the confidence factor,"" said Federal Reserve Board member John LaWare a few days ago.One reason for the lack of confidence, LaWare said, ""has been the political uncertainty that has hung over the economy during the presidential campaign.

If so, that could arouse renewed concern that the economy is sinking into a recession, intensifying pressure on the Federal Reserve System to drive down short-term interest rates further.Most analysts are expecting the Commerce Department today to report that the economy grew at about a 2.5% annual rate in the third quarter. That would be an improvement from the second quarter's dismal 0.6% rate, after adjusting for inflation. A few analysts even say third-quarter growth exceeded 3%.But rumors swept through the markets that the report will show the economy grew at only a 1% to 2% pace.

First-quarter revisions--down to 0.4% from 1.9%--reflected an economy at a near-standstill early in the year.That minimal growth, coming after a recession that new data show was deeper than previously thought, raises doubts about the economy's trajectory for the rest of the year and helps explain the unusually feeble pace of job growth for a recovery entering its third year.

That view was reinforced by weaker regional manufacturing data in recent weeks, as well as Friday's report on first-quarter gross domestic product.

0,"When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992."

1,"WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's economic advisers say the trend in U.S. productivity growth may be improving, boosting the prospects for growth in living standards in coming years.The Economic Report of the President, released yesterday, said the growth in U.S. productivity, which is a measure of the output per hour worked, has averaged about 2% a year since 1991 -- more than twice the 1978-87 average. Some of that may reflect a rebound from the recession; but even if measured from 1987, productivity has grown 1.2%, up from 0.9% in the 10 previous years.""There may have, indeed, been a structural change"" in productivity growth, said Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Such an increase could have positive implications for Americans' standards of living, which are ultimately determined by the productivity of American workers.But the president's economic report also points out that it may be too soon to jump to conclusions about productivity growth. For one thing, the statistics can be misleading. If the trends are computed for different periods -- 1978-86 and 1986-94 -- productivity growth averages only 1.1% in the latest period, up from 1% in the earlier period, not much of a difference. Also, recently released Labor Department data on hours worked suggest that productivity could be revised downward by one-tenth of a percentage point in 1993 and 1994.""While the evidence of a slight improvement in the productivity growth trend is encouraging, it is not yet decisive,"" the report said, adding that two more years of data may present a clearer picture."
0,"For some time now, it has been apparent that something has gone askew with the old-time relationship of economic growth to job creation. In the past couple of years, new technologies have enabled many companies, especially large manufacturers, to churn out the same volume of production with fewer and fewer employees.This phenomenon may represent a disconnect between economic growth and jobs, and set back President Clinton's hope for a meaningful economic recovery. The fact that unemployment sticks around 7 percent disturbs consumer confidence - not only among those out of work, but among people who still have jobs.Some analysts contend that there really is nothing new in the equation that a surge in demand won't cure: Eventually, optimists say, companies now using overtime and temporary workers to fill their labor needs will have to add to regular payrolls.But what will produce that rising demand? In the face of the deficit reduction program, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen admitted to a group of reporters last Tuesday, ""the second half {of 1993} will be better, but 1994 will not be a robust year."" He concedes that the net effect of deficit reduction - assuming that the Clinton package passes - could depress the economy.On top of all the other bad news, the Federal Reserve Board seems to be itching to raise interest rates. That could set up a classic confrontation between the administration and the supposedly friendly chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, who said last week: ""The signal we are endeavoring to send here is that at some point, rates are going to have to move up.""

The economy added 296,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said. For the past six months, job gains have averaged 257,000 a month and the labor market has been taut.Wage gains were also healthy during May. Average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers increased four cents to a seasonally adjusted $12.73. Average weekly earnings increased 0.9% to $441.73. Average weekly earnings and average hourly earnings have both risen 4.3% during the past year -- without many signs of inflationary pressures.The economy, though slowing from the 4.8% gross-domestic-product growth rate posted in the first quarter, still continues to generate jobs. Certainly, the Asian financial crisis has had an effect. The manufacturing sector has slowed its rate of growth in the second quarter, and manufacturing jobs declined 26,000 last month, the third drop in the past four months. Those declines, however, were offset by the brisk-paced service sector, which accounted for all of May's job gains.

1,"President Obama is working hard to refocus attention on the middle class, and rightly so. While a decent society will provide opportunity and, when necessary, direct assistance to the poor, the long-term health of our economy and our democracy depends on a prosperous, self-confident middle class.That's not what we've had in recent years. Median incomes fell sharply during the Great Recession and have barely begun to recover. Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable livesConcern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class. This isn't surprising, because the median income for all U.S. households rose by 32% during that period, from $44,845 in 1970 to $59,127 in 2010. Indeed, 86% of middle-class Americans, and 84% of all Americans, enjoy higher incomes than their parents did."

It evolved into a nationally respected example of hands-on learning.For almost four decades, teenagers in Rabun County on the wooded border of Georgia and North Carolina have interviewed their family members and neighbors, documenting countless lives in stories and photographs for the magazine produced entirely by high school students.In the process, Foxfire has made stars out of the Appalachian old- timers. Their stories and memories of the old ways -- everything from fiddle-making and faith-healing to moonshining, bear hunting and hog dressing -- were turned into an acclaimed series of books that fueled a national frenzy over folk art."

That isn't what you'll see in the authorized budget numbers, of course. But many of those numbers are at best suspect, and at worst part of a game that makes it easier for both parties to do what they want for short-term political reasons, while ignoring problems that are being sown for the long run.Why this gloomy analysis now? Because three troubling trend lines are coming together. First, it's increasingly clear that the tax-cut bill recently passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, while reasonable enough at its advertised size, has enough tricks and omissions in its details that its true effect on the budget is understated, perhaps by hundreds of billions of dollars.Second, Congress and the administration have put the tax cut within a 10-year spending plan that an optimist would call extremely ambitious -- and a skeptic would call wholly unrealistic. It anticipates Congress somehow will keep spending increases for the next decade to roughly half the average of the last couple of years -- and that the Bush administration won't weigh in with big new defense-spending or substantial emergency-spending requests.Third, both parties in Congress already are showing in real life why such plans are at risk. President Bush's own Republicans are busy adding back into spending bills for next year items the White House doesn't want, pleasing fans of apple programs and water projects but undermining budget blueprints."

Because banks play a central role in financing economic growth, the credit crunch has broad effects on the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says it has ""very little historic precedent.""What caused it?With more and more loans going sour, the economy weakening and real estate values falling, bankers have grown more cautious. The memories of the excesses and financial failures of the 1980s are crimping lending in the 1990s. In addition, new rules, or capital standards, require many banks to either raise more capital from investors or make fewer loans. Unable or unwilling to raise capital, many banks are pulling back on lending."

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so- called core consumer prices -- which are believed to give a more stable reading of inflation -- advanced just 0.1% last month. And the year-over-year rate of inflation, at 4.9%, is coming down from high levels reached this summer.There was widespread softness in pricing. Transportation prices fell 0.6% as airline fares and new-car prices dropped. Housing, which accounts for 40% of the consumer-price index, fell 0.1% for a second straight month, the first back-to-back declines since 2001. Clothing prices fell 0.1% for the month.Other signs of economic weakness are building, including a report by the Fed on Thursday that U.S. industrial production dropped sharply in September.The inflation readings underscore a growing belief inside the Fed that inflation pressures are easing, as many senior officials expected earlier this year.

Indeed, conditions are so strong that some executives say they are able to raise prices on their products for the first time in several years, a possible harbinger of higher inflation.""We see very strong growth,"" says Donald Rainville, president of Universal Dynamics Inc., a small company in Woodbridge, Va., that manufactures machinery used in making plastics.

The rate was the lowest since late April, when 30-year rates averaged 5.94 percent.Since peaking at a high for this year of 6.34 percent in mid- May, 30-year mortgage rates have been headed lower, reflecting in part a slowdown in economic activity in June.The economy hit what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday termed a ""soft patch"" in June. Greenspan, however, in delivering the Fed's mid-year economic forecast to Congress, sought to allay fears that the slowdown could threaten the sustainability of the recovery. He predicted that growth would soon rebound even as the Fed proceeds with what Greenspan indicated should be a gradual pace of rate increases.Frank Nothaft, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said that the Fed's outlook for the second half of this year was ""more upbeat than expected,"" and he said this stronger growth will translate into further increases in mortgage rates and other interest rates set by financial markets along with the rise in short-term rates controlled by the Fed.

It's still early December and my feeling at this point is that statistically an ease in monetary policy in December can still be made between now and Dec. 19, when the Federal Open Market Committee meets. That is, if we continue to get the same kinds of soft economic data that we have had over that last few months."

As the Federal Open Market Committee enters its second day of meetings, its members should welcome a sign of waning consumer optimism.The May number, revised upward to 144.7 from a preliminary 144.4, equaled the record set in January. The index jumped seven points in May after moving up less than a point in April.""We see a little slackening in expectations for businesses,"" said Lynn Franco, the economist who oversees the New York market research firm's survey of 5,000 households. ""Overall it's just basically a little bit of cooling, but not enough to slide into a recession."" Historically, she said, June's 138.8 reading is very strong.Numerous reports in recent weeks, from construction to employment to consumer spending, have shown signs that the Fed's cycle of tightening may finally be reining in the galloping economy. ""It points toward a slowing economy"" but is ""not really alarming,"" said Ms. Franco."

They expect the Federal Reserve to tighten credit again soon in an effort to slow economic growth, restrain inflation and support the dollar.Even if rates do rise, that probably won't stop the six-year-old economic expansion anytime soon, analysts say. Most economists in several recent surveys predicted continued economic growth for at least another six months to a year. But investors may react to rising rates by selling stocks and long-term bonds.A surge in short-term rates over the past three weeks already has prompted many investors to switch their funds into such short-term investments as six-month Treasury bills, which now yield more than 8 1/2%. That's only about 2/3 of a percentage point below 30-year Treasury bondsand it's nearly five percentage points higher than the dividend yield on the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's Corp. index.Recent interviews with Fed officials suggest that the central bank has no immediate plans to tighten credit.

Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing established, blue-chip stocks, is fluctuating the most it has in a decade.Investors had better get used to it. The broad embrace of ""momentum"" investing by big and small investors alike, the growth of technology stocks that are intrinsically volatile, and the Internet's instant news and inexpensive trading all suggest that the market is becoming more susceptible to sudden surges and swoons.How much does this volatility really matter? Clearly, that depends partly on where stocks go from here.

1,"NEW YORK -- The prospect that the Federal Reserve could avert a recession through its aggressive easing of monetary policy is tolling a bearish knell for Treasurys.Last week, the Fed unexpectedly cut interest rates by a half percentage point, its fourth rate reduction of that size this year. That pushed the Federal funds rate, or overnight bank lending level, down to 4.5%.Bond investors always fear that returns on fixed-income securities such as Treasurys could be eroded in the long term if stronger growth is accompanied by higher inflation. Thus, in their view, what's good for the economy isn't necessarily healthy for the Treasurys market.Reflecting such fears, the 30-year Treasury bond Friday ended at about its highest yield of the year so far, or 5.793%. Its price, which moves inversely to its yield, was down 3/32 point from late Thursday at 94 1/32.Meantime, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 2/32 point, or 62 cents per $1,000 face value, at 97 26/32.

1,"Beware inflated expectations. Investors are beginning to bet that a return of food-price inflation will boost grocery-store profits. Retailers can sometimes keep their percentage markups constant when input costs rise.The cost of food for home consumption does indeed look set for a rebound. After falling 2.4% last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, retailers are beginning to predict that it will resume its upward march. This week, Wal-Mart Stores said it expects food deflation to abate this year and Winn-Dixie forecast outright inflation in the second quarter. Friday's consumer-price index data for January could add to the evidence.This year could be more complicated than usual. First, the initial round of food inflation is likely to occur in perishables such as milk, whose price has already rebounded in recent months. Just as some grocers saw perishables volumes rise last year when prices fell, the reverse could be true if prices rise.Second, packaged-food prices could keep falling for some time. Even if raw ingredient costs begin to rise, many manufacturers have locked in lower raw-material prices using hedges. Meredith Adler of Barclays Capital estimates packaged food accounts for 40% of the average grocer's revenue.Finally, moves by the likes of Costco and Wal-Mart to sell more private-label products could damp food-price inflation."
1,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is likely, in light of November's strong employment figures, to decide to raise short-term interest rates at its policy meeting Dec. 14.Interviews with Fed governors and district presidents who make up the central bank's policy committee suggest that many of them believe higher interest rates are needed to cool down the economy and prevent an acceleration of inflation.The 463,000-job increase in payroll employment ""was far bigger than anyone thought it was going to be,"" said Robert Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The latest numbers add to ""anecdotal information from our district that the economy continues to be robust,"" agrees Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins. ""There is some sign here that policy should continue to err on the side of containing inflation.""But the Fed is unlikely to take decisive action before the Dec. 14 meeting unless it is confronted with a steep decline in the dollar. That's because officials are reluctant to appear overly responsive to monthly employment figures. ""Taking one month's figures and reacting in a knee-jerk manner is inappropriate for policymakers,"" says Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Fed, expressing a view that was echoed by other Fed officials.The presidents of the 12 Fed district banks have been leading the charge this year for a tighter monetary policy. The employment figures out Friday clearly reinforced their hawkish views. ""I can't claim I was terribly surprised by the tenor of the report,"" said Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Fed. ""The economy out here for quite some time now has been doing well."""
1,"What with the low bar that analysts typically set for them, it shouldn't be a shocker that companies' first-quarter earnings are clearing estimates. But the margin that they're clearing them by is pretty impressive.With results from about 271 of companies in the index already in, first-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now on track for a gain of 3.6% versus a year ago, according to S&P Capital IQ. That isn't very strong, but it is much better than the 0.5% that analysts were looking for at the start of this month. And given that about half the companies in the index have yet to report, and that they, too, will likely top estimates, actual earnings growth will likely be higher still.Sales-growth figures, on the other hand, have been going the other way. As of Friday, S&P 500 revenue was on track for a gain of 1.4% versus a year ago. At the beginning of the month, that gain was pegged at 4%. Another sign of the divide between what's happening to the top and bottom lines: Only 43% of companies have topped revenue estimates thus far, compared with 70% for earnings.The decline in revenue-growth expectations isn't as bad as it seems at first blush, however. Much of it is concentrated in the energy and basic materials sectors, and reflects a decline in commodity prices that is helping drive down costs to other companies, as well as consumers.And once again, the overall weakness in revenue seems concentrated in companies' foreign, rather than domestic, operations. Some evidence for that: Friday's gross domestic product report for the U.S. showed that final sales to domestic purchasers were up 3% in the first quarter. Since large public companies, if anything, tend to generate better sales growth than the overall economy is experiencing, it is pretty clear that overseas sales are the real weak spot."

But yesterday's expiration of April options contracts likely depressed the index. That is because dealers unwound hedges that had been initiated to offset risk associated with filling options orders executed by money managers and retail investors.Indeed, Schaeffer's Investment Research, a trading-advisory firm, advised clients that it was shifting its short-term stock-market outlook to neutral from bullish because the VIX is trending higher. The VIX has closed above the psychologically significant 30 level for five of the past six sessions.

1,"Blacks and Hispanics in the Washington area were at least twice as likely as whites to be denied mortgage credit by local lenders in 1993, according to data released this week by the Federal Reserve.However, loan applicants of all races throughout the area were less likely to be denied credit than were applicants in the country as a whole, the Fed reported.We're severely disappointed in the new numbers, said John Taylor, president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a District-based group that monitors lending in poor communities. Banks have said for at least two years that they are stepping up minority lending, Taylor said, and ""this was the year that we should have seen an appreciable difference.In the metropolitan area, which includes several Maryland counties and extends south to Prince William County, 14.2 percent of blacks and 9.4 percent of Hispanics were denied mortgages, compared with 5 percent of whites. Lending rates for individual institutions were not disclosed.Stephen S. Fuller, a George Mason University professor who writes a monthly report on the Washington area economy, said the difference in denial rates is ""partly explained by educational level, and that educational level affects the income, or career, or job type that a population seems to be characterized by."" It's very dangerous to generalize like this, Fuller added, but ""there are some legitimate reasons for these differences. . .. The question is, are those [reasons] sufficient to explain the magnitude of the differences described, and the answer is no, he said."

0,"WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in two years as the holiday season failed to lift the spirit of Americans rattled by stock-market volatility and mounting fears of a significant economic slowdown.The Conference Board said consumer confidence slid to 128.3 in December from a revised 132.6 a month earlier. The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop.The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth.Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity; shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one.That prospect was very much on the minds of Conference Board officials, who described the fall in confidence as ""somewhat disconcerting."""

Curtice predicted a record year for the economy and said his company would spend a billion dollars on expansion in 1956; when President Eisenhower sent Congress not only a balanced budget but proposals for a rise in government spending; when steel output was announced as reaching a new weekly high."

1,"Government reports yesterday indicated that the U.S. economy is surging ahead, with the Commerce Department now likely to revise its estimate for growth in the final three months of last year to around 5 percent from 3.8 percent, analysts said.Yesterday's reports showed that factory output hit a new peak last month, new claims for unemployment benefits fell early this month and the nation's merchandise trade deficit declined to $7 billion in December rather than rising as expected.For all of 1992, exports rose $26.4 billion from 1991, but imports went up a larger $45.4 billion, as the year's deficit rose to $84.3 billion from the previous year's $65.4 billion. It was the first increase since 1987 when the deficit hit a record $152.1 billion.The Labor Department also reported that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month, the biggest monthly rise in two years. However, experts said the increase did not signal an acceleration of inflation.The report on December's trade balance and other recent data on the fourth quarter have been considerably stronger than expected. ""What today's data mean is that {gross domestic product} will be revised to well over 5 percent,"" the financial markets research firm of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., told its clients."

1,"Enough about John Maynard Keynes. We can be sure the 20th century British economic giant would advise more government spending to spur U.S. economic growth with consumers and businesses so hesitant and short-term interest rates at zero.What would Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago champion of monetary discipline, do now? What would he say -- reversing the charges when he returned a reporter's call, as he always did -- if asked about Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's imminent move to print hundreds of billions of dollars to buy more Treasury bonds to put more money into the economy?We can't ask him. He died in 2006. ""Friedman,"" says one of his eminent students, Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, ""was such an original thinker that one could never guess how he would react to a new question."" Nevertheless, this seems a ripe moment to contemplate Friedman's views and those of his disciples.Friedman believed in the power of money: the more money, the more income and, eventually, the more inflation. He didn't think the Fed could deliver full employment. He regarded interest rates as a misleading measure of whether the Fed was loose or tight.He didn't trust central bankers. He blamed the Bank of Japan for the deflation of the 1990s and the Fed for the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Inflation of the 1970s. He would, if his co-author Anna Schwartz is any clue, have condemned recent bank bailouts."
1,"The Clinton bandwagon may not make it north of the Arctic Circle, where Republicans appear to have insulated themselves from forces prevailing in the Lower 48. Sen. Ted Stevens (R), who would chair Appropriations if the GOP keeps its majority, is breezing to a fifth term over former Anchorage school board member Theresa Obermeyer (D).They brought the GOP convention to San Diego, they followed Gov. Pete Wilson's prescription to pound away on crime, immigration and affirmative action, they campaigned the state long and hard, but Dole and Kemp have not been able to shake Clinton's grip on this richest electoral prize. Clinton has benefited from an economic recovery that -- in California at least -- was not visible before he became president, a cultural affinity for Hollywood and the pleasure-seekers up and down the coast, and four years of careful ministration to California needs, whether it be earthquake relief or a bailout of a flat-broke hospital system. Two public polls last week put Clinton 12 to 18 points up and he was confident enough of having put it away that he cut short his final swing to work in other states.A dozen House seats are in play, slightly more of them Republican, but in the end there may be few changes. Most prominent on the endangered species list is 16-term Rep. George Brown (D), a perennial target who this year faces an even tougher opponent in Superior Court Judge Linda Wilde (R). Brown, 76, did not help his chances when he remarked in a debate on education: ""I imagine Linda, because she is a lady, is afraid of math."" He is still trying to dig himself out of that one.Two other Democrats have serious challenges from the same opponents who came close to defeating them in 1994. Rep. Jane Harman (D) was taken into a recount by Susan Brooks (R), a local government official in Rancho Palos Verdes. Harman has a limitless bank account and is probably strong enough to stave off Brooks again. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Vic Fazio is in a rematch with real estate broker Tim LeFever (R), who came within 7,000 votes last time. LeFever was one of the Republicans who used an ad on the death penalty in which he morphed his opponent's face into that of Richard Allen Davis, murderer of Polly Klaas.Rep. Cal Dooley (D), who represents a conservative district near Bakersfield, always has a battle, this time with Assemblyman Trice Harvey (R)."

Last week, he gave a speech that used bold language to signal that Fed would cut interest rates to try to prevent a severe economic downturn. On Thursday, he told Congress how to design a stimulus package that would offer immediate help.The two moves are meant to assure financial markets, elected officials and the American public that the Fed is on the case.""The financial markets and the whole society are crying out for leadership,"" said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman. ""Bernanke as a person and the Fed as an institution are the places this leadership can come from.""It is all but inevitable, in the view of Fed leaders, that the economy will grow slowly in the first half of 2008.

0,"With U.S. economic growth slowing, the nation's unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent last month while employers' payrolls grew only modestly, the Labor Department reported yesterday.Analysts said the report provided further confirmation that growth has slowed recently from the very rapid pace of the first half of this year, which many economists and policymakers regarded as unsustainable. However, the details showed little sign of excessive weakness that would point to a serious slump.While employers added 94,000 workers to their payrolls, the total number of hours worked last month fell 0.2 percent as firms cut back slightly on the length of the average workweek. The reduction was sharpest in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls were virtually unchanged but hours worked dropped by 0.7 percent.""It looks pretty favorable to me,"" said economist James Glassman of Chase Securities in New York. ""You have more confirmation of the slowing in growth, but not so much that unemployment is rising sharply. If you could freeze everything where it is now, it would be just about perfect.""Growth has slowed to a sustainable rate, workers' pay is going up and inflation fears are waning,"" Glassman said. ""Everybody has gotten gloomy about the outlook because of companies warning about profits and the stock market is down. In financial markets, there is stress and worry about credit problems. But to me this is all part of the process of cooling off from a superheated growth rate."""

0,"WASHINGTON -- There hasn't been much doubt in recent days about what nation is the most powerful. The Iraq crisis shows that the U.S. is the only true superpower.All the talk about Japan or Germany being the new No. 1 has faded quickly -- at least for now. So has the idea that military power became irrelevant with the collapse of communism. These thoughts seem naive at a time when a military force has risen in the Persian Gulf that threatens the wealth on which Japanese and German clout has been built.Only the U.S. has the means to move mass military force around the globe in days and to rally numerous other nations to the cause. And, for all its economic woes, the U.S. can back up that military might with an economy far larger than any rival's.""This crisis in the Gulf is the answer to the argument that we've reached the end of history, that peace has broken out, that military power doesn't matter and the only coin of influence in the world is economic power,"" Harold Brown, a former defense secretary, said. These popular claims are being shown up as exaggerations.But no matter how good the crisis has made Americans feel so far, with President Bush rallying support by making frank allusions to stopping a new Hitler, it obscures the shift in the world power game. Military might still counts, but there is a new emphasis on economic strength, and the U.S. isn't well prepared to retain that aspect of global leadership."
1,"The latest readings on U.S. housing and business investment confounded economists' expectations, but the underlying trends still show the economy acting pretty much as Federal Reserve officials had hoped: Perhaps slowing, but not sinking.In two separate reports, the Commerce Department said new-home sales rose and businesses' orders for capital goods dropped in April. At first glance, that's at odds with the Fed's main scenario for what the economy will do this year: Consumer spending should slow as a weakening housing market makes people feel poorer, but increased business investment -- in the form of capital-goods purchases and hiring -- should help keep the deceleration from becoming a disaster.Economists, however, warned against reading too much into the volatile monthly data, saying that longer-term trends still point toward slowing home sales and growing capital spending. ""We all agree that the housing market is cooling off, and some other sector of the economy must take the burden of keeping growth healthy,"" said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ""Capital spending is a prime candidate.""New-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million in April, up 4.9% from the previous month, thanks in part to a surge in Southern states. The number contrasted sharply with expectations of an April drop in home sales, but downward revisions to the previous months' numbers lessened the surprise. After revisions, the rate of new-home sales dropped 7.6% over the first three months of 2006, compared with a previous estimate of 4.2%. April's rate of sales was still 12.4% below the most recent peak in July 2005.""The overall picture is one of a cooling housing market,"" said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. a New York consultancy. ""It's hard to argue against that."" Declining demand, for example, was among the reasons cited by luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc. when it announced earlier this week that it was lowering its full-year earnings forecast."

1,"NEW YORK -- Bonds suffered their worst one-day plunge in more than four months as newly released data sparked concerns that the economy's continued head-turning growth will cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least once next year to keep inflation under wraps.In late trading, the bellwether 30-year Treasury fell 1 11/32, or $13.438 for a bond with $1,000 face value, to 97 17/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.295%. It was the benchmark bond's worst one-day performance since Aug. 6.Shorter-term securities also dropped. Two-year notes, for example, fell 6/32 to yield 6.045%. Volume was $49.4 billion, higher than the average of the last week and last 30 days, according to GovPX Inc., which tracks trading volume at five of the six interdealer brokers.Investors were spooked by a stronger-than-expected retail-sales report for November.

Excluding autos, however, sales were up 0.4%, in line with forecasts.In addition, October sales were revised to show an overall increase of 0.3% from an unchanged reading in the initial report.

0,"Data released this week by the Commerce Department waved bright red recession flags--orders for durable goods fell 13.2% in August and inflation-adjusted personal income fell 0.3%. President Obama is asking for more time to allow the lackluster recovery to pick up steam. His plan is to move the economy ""forward"" by keeping the current policy framework in place and adding higher tax rates on income and capital gains. But the new Commerce Department numbers, combined with his stay-the-course approach, point to recession in 2013.This administration's economic policy is built on deficit spending, government control over the economy and dependence on the Federal Reserve to buy the government's excess debt. These policies aren't working. They discourage private investment and jobs, and the policies have resulted in high unemployment, weak business confidence and rapidly declining median incomes.The signature of our times is the fever for investing in government bonds and $1,700-an-ounce gold rather than in job creation and small businesses. That is the market's response to Obama administration efforts to reverse core American principles of growth and prosperity.These principles include a sound dollar to provide price stability and to attract capital; a commitment to limited government as a prerequisite for higher living standards; a preference for low tax rates to encourage investment and hiring; and a belief that markets can set prices and allocate capital better than governments.The administration will have spent more than $14 trillion in just four years and added $6 trillion to the national debt. The Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded its role in the economy and markets, practically creating a new branch of government. Its near-zero interest-rate policy favors government, the world's biggest borrower, at the expense of private-sector savers. The Fed's heavily leveraged purchases of government bonds work against the market-based allocation of capital that is a key driver of economic growth. The Fed has now promised to make unlimited future purchases of government debt if job growth remains weak, an affront to the principle of limited government."

As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums.

0,"The breaking-off of budget negotiations between President Reagan and congressional leaders yesterday leaves the nation facing a string of huge budget deficits and continuing high interest rates, with little chance for a sustained economic recovery anytime soon.Congress still could find some way to reduce the deficits. But, in the absence of major spending cuts and tax increases, interest rates are likely to stay so high that the important, housing and auto industries almost certainly will remain deeply depressed, according to a number of economists. The high rates also probably will lead businesses to keep cutting back their capital investment plans, the key to healthy, longterm economic growth.Murray L. Weidenbaum, Reagan's chief economist, recently said that even the $56 billion worth of spending cuts and revenue-raising measures proposed in the president's February budget are not regarded as large enough to relieve pressures in financial markets and bring interest rates down. There will be a slower, less robust recovery if there is no budget accord, he said. .POLICY, From A1 mann, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Co., a New York investment banking firm, said last week that in the absence of a significant change in the budgetary trend currently in prospect... we expect that any drops in interest rates will be shortlived, which should serve effectively to limit the scope of economic expansion this year and next.One of the few points on which the administration and congressional negotiators agreed was that, without tax increases or further spending cuts, the 1983 deficit likely would be about $180 billion, and that figure assumed that the economy would begin growing at about a 4 percent annual 'rate at mid-year.

Economists say it is has been of greater depth, and likely will have more lasting consequences, than it did during prior downturns.In good part, that's because the soaring housing market has lifted the median price of single-family homes by 15%, making property taxes attractive to state and municipal governments facing spending increases. Meanwhile, states have grown more reluctant to lift income or sales taxes in recent years for fear of political retribution, economists say. In some cases, they are even prevented from doing so by laws passed during the 1990s boom.""The local property tax is one tax the local [authorities] can use to offset declines in state money,"" says William Fischel, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. ""To some extent, if the state is sending municipalities or even school districts less money because they're in fiscally difficult times, the one tax the local [authorities] have some discretion over raising is the property tax.""Though municipalities can offset rising property values by changing their millage rates, or the rates at which taxes are levied on properties, many strapped municipalities chose not to do so in recent years.

0,"In normal times, the best advice after a market decline is ""Don't be afraid."" But these are not normal times, and anyone who is not afraid after a 50% market decline has a few screws loose. The trick is to channel your fear into sensible action that will improve your financial future.Instead of big impulsive steps you may regret later, you should take small and careful steps that will make you feel you have taken charge. Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable. At a time like this, taking a little bit of action can give you a lot of comfort -- both as an immediate salve for your market wounds today and as a portfolio strengthener in the years to come.For investors, that means being deliberate in everything you do and making sure that all your decisions are gradual and incremental, rather than sudden and drastic. Call it ""smart panic"" -- calculated actions that free you from the chains of inertia without compelling you to go haywire.Normally, inertia keeps investors locked into all their investments, good and bad. As Sir Isaac Newton might have put it, an investor at rest stays at rest, and an investor in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. Severe losses can shock any investor out of inertia, often in destructive ways.Here is a list of constructive steps you can take instead:"
1,"To the market's surprise the most recent Federal Open Market Committee statement didn't even hint at the threats implicit in the rise in commodity prices, especially oil, or the dollar's fall. These events have lowered the threat of deflation to virtually zero, but the Fed insists that deflation is still a slightly higher risk than inflation. Is the Fed keeping its head in the sand? Is Alan Greenspan bowing to George Bush and the upcoming election? Even before the Fed meeting, an increasing number of commentators insisted the Fed is too easy. Now such criticism has reached a crescendo.On the surface, the censure seems justified. Commodity prices are rapidly increasing; the Commodity Research Bureau index of actively traded commodities is now at a level not seen since the inflation bubble of 1980. Oil stays stubbornly high, near $40 per barrel, and the Journal of Commerce Index of lightly processed commodities, once a favorite Greenspan indicator, has soared to an all-time high. And although the dollar has stabilized, it is down 25% against a basket of currencies since early 2002. Finally, the real Fed funds rate has been negative for two years and relative to real economic growth, the most negative since the inflationary '70s.But there are good responses to these points. The rising commodity prices are due to China, which is churning out lower priced goods that keep inflation in check. The dollar has indeed dropped, but two years ago economists were saying it was too high. Today it's at, or just below, its purchasing power parity level, consistent with the persistent current account deficit. Furthermore, the smart money in the oil futures market says that the price is coming down sharply. And there is also a good response to the low real rates, a key variable in the critics' argument. Inflation hawks have maintained that by keeping the after-inflation cost of money negative, the Fed is feeding the fires of future inflation.But if monetary policy were really too accommodating, wouldn't we see rising interest rates in the bond market? Yet with the 10-year bond yield under 4%, we see no such concern. Are those calling for higher rates saying that the bond vigilantes -- who have kept government and the Fed honest by pushing bond prices lower when the Fed's action has been inflationary -- are flat out wrong? That would be a sharp reversal from the past when the bond market was routinely praised for warning errant governments of monetary and fiscal profligacy.With the 10-year indexed bond yielding a record-low 1.4%, a zero or even negative real Fed funds rate -- what we have now -- looks about right. If the Fed raised short-term rates, it would risk flattening or inverting the yield curve, something very dangerous early in a recovery."

1,"An international economist or investor will claim that the international sentiment toward currencies, trade and the economic outlook in the United States, as seen through the eyes of investors in Frankfurt, Tokyo and London, was the principal determinant of interest rates in 1987.Our heavy dependence on capital from foreign investors to finance both the federal budget deficit and the current account deficit (of which the trade deficit is the largest component) were the underlying factors.The international investor considers opportunity costs in evaluating investment prospects in terms of the premium on U.S. rates over domestic rates. Consequently, faced with larger investment risks in dollar-denominated securities, foreign investors demanded larger-than-usual yields to entice them into owning U.S. bonds.In the United States, the main problems were what to do about the dollar whether to defend it or allow it to move lower in hopes of reversing the trade deficit and how to attract foreign capital in order to finance the trade and budget deficits.Initially, the Treasury's dollar policy was anchored in the Louvre Accord, in which the Group of Seven industrialized nations the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy agreed to support the dollar while the United States made efforts to reduce the budget deficit."

There was little change in the rate of production for automobile and other consumer goods.Industrial production was measured at 144.4 on the Federal Reserve's scale compared to 144.2 in July. This meant that production of the Nation's factories and mines was 44.4 per cent higher than the 1957-59 level.The gain was the smallest since April but it marked the 10th straight month that the index has moved upward.

The figure was slightly lower than the previous estimate of 2.6%, a revision most economists said was insignificant.On the surface, the two reports seemed to mitigate some fears that the economy is growing too rapidly to hold prices in line. The increase in consumer prices was lower than many analysts expected, and, to most, reinforced a Labor Department report Friday that showed wholesale prices in November rose only 0.3% as well.Moreover, the third-quarter GNP expansion was significantly slower than in the first and second quarters, when GNP grew at 3.4% and 3.0% respectively."

1,"WASHINGTON -- Surging imports from Europe and Japan caused the U.S. trade deficit to widen to $10.29 billion in January from $8.03 billion the previous month, the Commerce Department said.The widening in January came despite a 3.3% decline in the value of petroleum imports, which are often volatile. Total imports rose 9.2%.The large January deficit makes it clear that the easing of the nation's trade problems at the end of last year was temporary, reflecting a slowdown in imports as a result of sluggish economic growth in the third quarter.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the 10% rise in the value of the dollar last year, plus the 9% jump since December, could push the deficit to a record $140 billion this year. The trade deficit in 1984 was a record $123.31 billion, compared with $69.39 billion in 1983, the previous record.A strong dollar can widen the trade deficit by lowering the cost of imports to U.S. buyers and raising the cost of exports to foreign buyers. The problem is exacerbated by strong economic growth in this country, which encourages the purchase of foreign goods, and relatively sluggish growth overseas, which discourages purchases of U.S. products."

0,"For three long years, the U.S. has been undertaking an experiment in economic policy. Could record levels of government spending, waves of new regulation and political credit allocation, and unprecedented monetary stimulus re-ignite growth? The results have been rolling in, and they represent what increasingly looks like an historic mistake that deserves to be called the Keynesian growth discount.***The latest evidence is yesterday's disappointing report of 1.8% in first quarter GDP. At this stage of recovery after a deep recession, the economy is typically growing by 4% or more as consumer confidence returns and businesses accelerate investment as their profits revive. Yet in this recovery consumers are still cautious and business investment remains weak.Some of the first quarter's growth slump is due to seasonal factors such as bad weather and weaker defense spending. In the silver lining department, the private economy grew faster than the overall GDP figure because government spending declined. But even maintaining the 2.9% growth rate of 2010 would mark an historic underachievement for a recovery after a recession that was as deep as the one from late 2007 to mid-2009.The most recent recession of comparable depth and job loss was in 1981-1982, when unemployment hit 10.8%. Huge chunks of industrial America shut down and never re-opened. Yet once the recovery began in earnest in the first quarter of 1983, the economy boomed. As the nearby table shows, growth exceeded 7.1% for five consecutive quarters, and it kept growing at nearly a 4% pace for another two years. Growth didn't dip below 2% in any quarter until the second three months of 1986. This was the Reagan boom."
0,"Some optimistic experts are now saying that though this will be a turbulent year for global markets, the worst of the financial crisis is now behind us. Would it were so. We believe that 2009 will be tougher than many anticipate.We enter the new year grappling with the most serious global economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The U.S. economy is, at best, halfway through a recession that began in December 2007 and will prove the longest and most severe of the postwar period. Credit losses of close to $3 trillion are leaving the U.S. banking and financial system insolvent. And the credit crunch will persist as households, financial firms and corporations with high debt ratios and solvency problems undergo a sharp deleveraging process.Worse, all of the world's advanced economies are in recession. Many emerging markets, including China, face the threat of a hard landing. Some fear that these conditions will produce a dangerous spike in inflation, but the greater risk is for a kind of global ""stag-deflation"": a toxic combination of economic stagnation, recession and falling prices. We're likely to see vulnerable European markets (Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria), key Latin American markets (Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico), Asian countries (Pakistan, Indonesia and South Korea), and countries like Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states facing severe financial pressure.Policy remedies will have limited effect as insolvency problems constrain the effectiveness of monetary stimulus, and the risk of rising interest rates (following the issuance of a wave of public debt) erodes the growth effects of fiscal stimulus packages. Only when insolvent banks are shut down, others are cleaned up, and the debt level of insolvent households is reduced will conditions ease. Between now and then, we can expect further downside risks to equity markets and other risky assets, given the likelihood that markets will continue to be jolted by worse-than-expected financial news.The U.S. twin fiscal and current-account deficits will rise over the next two years as the country runs trillion dollar-plus fiscal deficits. We're all aware that foreign actors have financed most of this debt over the past several years. During the 1980s, the U.S. also faced the burdens of twin deficits, but relied on financing from key strategic partners like Japan and Germany. This time, the situation is more worrisome because today's financing comes not from U.S. allies, but from strategic rivals like Russia, China and a number of relatively unstable petrostates. This leaves the U.S. perilously dependent on the kindness of strangers."

But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it.

No company with an investment-grade rating defaulted.Many analysts blame the economic recession for the rise in defaults in the past year. And as the business downturn deepens, making it difficult for companies to meet debt payments as their revenue dwindles, the analysts expect junk-bond defaults to multiply.The junk-bond market has shriveled, with only $1.4 billion of new junk-bond issues during 1990.

The view is that today's economy cannot support unemployment rates below 5%--like the levels that prevailed before the recession and in the late 1990s. Those in government may take some comfort in this view. It lowers expectations and provides a rationale for the dismal labor market.Excuses aside, this issue is also important for central banks. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have some policy choices to make if the high rates of unemployment reflect cyclic phenomena. But if the problem is structural--perhaps reflecting a mismatch between skills needed by business and skills possessed by the unemployed--there is little the Fed can do.Research I've done with James Spletzer of the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the problems in the labor market are not structural. They reflect slow economic growth, and the cure is a decent recovery.In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4%. Two years later, it reached 10%. The structure of a modern economy does not change that quickly. The demographic composition of the labor force, its educational breakdown and even the industrial mix did not differ much between 2007 and 2009.More specifically, from 2007 to 2009 unemployment grew dramatically in a few industries, and these changes contributed to the rise in overall unemployment. But the changes were similar to those experienced in prior recessions. As unemployment rates declined somewhat after 2009, the pattern played out in reverse. Industries that saw the largest increases in unemployment were the ones with the largest decreases as overall unemployment fell."

After seasonal adjustments, it added, the February deficit was recalculated at $10.4 billion.The department said a complete revision of the figures will be released today.Even the relatively small rise in imports prompted many economists to scale back their optimistic estimates of gross-domestic-product growth for the first quarter. Surprisingly strong reports on consumer spending and industrial production had led to ""a consensus number for the first quarter of 4.5% growth,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis, well above the strong 3.8% growth in the fourth quarter. The trade numbers, he said ""could knock anywhere from 0.75 to 1.25 percentage points off first-quarter GDP estimates."""

There are always tradeoffs and harm from price controls, and quantitative easing has been the most ambitious and far-reaching price-control policy ever attempted. QE's massive bond purchases and money creation eroded market confidence and sidelined capital for many who attributed a phony recovery and an artificial economy to QE. Mohammed El Erian, the CEO of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund manager, points out that Fed creation of money in $4 trillion of QE bond purchases added a mere quarter of 1% (0.25%) to GDP growth -- a lousy tradeoff considering the heightened risks of inflation from QE money expansion and the risks of Fed insolvency from the attendant precipitous fall in bond prices.In spite of the rise in asset prices of stocks and real estate from QE policies, it may turn out that far less new wealth was actually created if those prices deflate when QE liquidity is withdrawn.QE has been accompanied by the worst post-recession recovery on record since the Great Depression in terms of GDP growth and a 40-year low in the labor-force participation rate. By maintaining interest rates at abnormally low levels, QE masks the real cost of the growing entitlement state while it also helped bailout and re-elect President Obama, resulting in a continuation of failed fiscal policies and the postponement of the day of reckoning on national debt and entitlement reform, which are essential for sustainable economic recovery.Scott S.

But income tax payments were down this April, reflecting the impact of the recession, which has pushed millions of people out of work.The Obama administration forecast in February that the deficit for this year would hit $1.56 trillion, surpassing the record of $1.4 trillion set last year. Many private-sector economists think that this year's imbalance will be closer to the $1.4 trillion set last year and that deficits will remain high for years to come.The trillion-dollar-plus deficits are being driven by the effects of the recession, which has cut government tax revenue while driving up spending.Analysts estimate that roughly one-third of the increase in deficits over the past two years can be attributed to lost revenue -- the result of fewer people working and lower corporate profits. Another third was from increased government spending that normally occurs in a downturn, such as higher payments for unemployment benefits and food stamps. The final third reflects added government spending on the $787 billion stimulus bill and the $700 billion financial bailout."

Other periods of substantial increases in domestic spending, including the Nixon and Carter administrations, were accompanied by cuts in military spending. President Ronald Reagan boosted money for the mili- tary while trimming the domestic budget.In the short term, the latest spending hike is one factor helping to pull the nation out of recession. But over the long run, some experts say, most of the spending will be a drag on the economy, heighten the risk of sustained budget deficits and limit the maneuvering room of policymakers when, 10 years from now, the government must help fund the baby boomers' health care and retirement needs.""We should be very concerned,"" said John Cogan, a budget expert at the Hoover Institution who advised the Bush campaign.

0,"THE POLITICIANS pay too little attention; the 1988 income and poverty figures just issued by the Census Bureau are bad news.The longest sustained economic expansion in peacetime history has failed to drive the poverty rate back to the lows of the 1970s; the economy famous for lifting all boats no longer does so. Real per capita income was up, but this broadest measure of economic well-being is an average. As in other recent years, for the richest two-fifths of families median income and income share rose; for the poorest two-fifths they declined. The gap between rich and poor was the highest in the 40-odd years it has been measured.The poverty rate was 13.1 percent, more than one American in eight, down only 0.3 percent from the year before. The bureau called that steady. For children, who made up 40 percent of the poor, the rate was 19.7 percent, the highest of any age group; for blacks, 31.6 percent; black children, 44.6 percent; Hispanics and Hispanic children, 26.8 percent and 37.9 percent. For the elderly it was 12 percent, lower than for the population as a whole.Weak wages are one of the reasons the economy no longer functions as it used to. In real terms the earnings of men working full-time year-round declined last year, while those of women were flat. Median family income was also flat for the first time since the recovery began in 1982. When married couples gain ground, it is often because both wife and husband work, but not even steady work is enough to save all families. A sixth of poor families last year were headed by people, mostly men, who worked full-time year-round.The policy implications of these figures are as obvious as they are resisted. The need is not to cut the capital gains tax, but to raise the minimum wage, to liberalize the earned-income tax credit for the working poor with children, and perhaps also to make the existing child care credit refundable and available to those too poor to owe any taxes. All four of these proposals are before Congress. Rejecting the first while enacting the others would move money from people who most emphatically do not need it to others who do."

In addition to the drop of oil prices below $50 a barrel and the resolution of a bitterly fought presidential campaign, the government reported recently that hiring in October was stronger than expected, all factors that should underpin confidence.""Consumers will remain spending-minded,"" said Richard Curtin, the Michigan economist who oversees the confidence survey.

The latest figures pointed to a remarkably strong 7.4% annualized gain in inflation-adjusted consumer spending through the first two months of the third quarter, according to Bear Stearns estimates. If that spending pace was sustained through September -- final data won't be available until next month -- it would be the largest quarterly spending increase since 1985.""Massive tax relief has boosted disposable income and real consumer spending,"" Steven Wood, an economist with Insight Economics, said in a note to clients. ""This fiscal stimulus will provide a strong boost to third-quarter"" growth.It is still too early to say whether the latest spurt of spending will be sustainable. Consumer-confidence surveys remain soft, in part because companies haven't started hiring en masse, and that is restraining wages and salaries.

But William F. Klausing, senior vice president of Irving Trust's public utilities division, argues that ""interest rates are less important today than years ago in analyzing"" utility stocks. ""It's a whole new ballgame,"" he adds.Mr. Klausing's point, echoed by some analysts, is that, after many years of multibillion dollar construction programs, utilities no longer borrow large amounts to build new plants because such investments appear too risky politically. Hence, the expenses of utilities have become less sensitive to interest rates.To be sure, state regulators are trimming utilities' authorized rates of return -- and hence their profit potential -- in response to interest rate declines in the past few years. But, analysts note, many utilities have become units of holding companies. Profit from these publicly traded firms' non-regulated operations -- and from sales of electricity in the wholesale or bulk-power market -- have become important to a company's overall profitability.So what should the savvy investor look for in an electric-utility stock?"

1,"WASHINGTON -- Forecasters surveyed quarterly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia expect the economy to grow faster this year than they did previously, but they don't expect inflation to be any worse this year.The median of the 37 forecasts is for the U.S. economy to expand at an annual rate of 3.2% in the current quarter, 2.8% in the third quarter and 2.7% in the fourth; three months ago, they were predicting inflation-adjusted growth rates of 2.7%, 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively.After a hiccup in consumer prices in the current quarter because of higher oil prices, the economists expect consumer-price inflation to calm to a 2.1% pace in 1999 and rise slightly to 2.3% in 2000, the same as they did in a February survey. Over the next decade, the forecasters expect 2.5% annual increases in the consumer-price index.But the Philadelphia Fed cautioned that two-thirds of the new forecasts were received before the government reported a surprisingly sharp increase in the CPI in April.As they have in previous surveys, the forecasters said they expect the year 2000 computer glitch to increase inflation-adjusted growth by an average of 0.3 percentage point this year and shave 0.3 point off growth early next year. As a result, the forecasters expect the economy to slow to a 1.8% growth rate in the first quarter of 2000 and then to rebound to a 3.0% pace in the second."

1,"We are all waiting, it seems, for the next recession. Everyone knows that the business cycle hasn't been repealed, and so another recession is inevitable. Some indicators suggest that it might be sooner rather than later. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index has declined for three straight months. In March, 30 percent of respondents said jobs are ""plentiful""; now that's only 24 percent. All this inspires much foreboding, because a recession is widely regarded as a calamity or something close to it.Just last week, the Federal Reserve cut its key overnight interest rate for the second time since August. It now stands at 4.5 percent, down from its recent peak of 5.25 percent. Although the economy grew at a strong 3.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, most economists regard this as an aberration. They expect slower growth or a recession, because three powerful forces are assaulting the economic expansion.First, housing. Its collapse deepens. Economist Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley notes that sales of new and existing homes have dropped 42 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from their peaks of more than two years ago. As supplies of unsold homes grow, real estate prices continue to fall. One index finds that prices in August were down 4.4 percent nationally from a year earlier.Second, oil prices. They're approaching $100 a barrel. Even before the latest price increases, energy costs rose to 6.2 percent of consumer spending in the second quarter; that's up from 4.5 percent in 2002, notes consultant Jack Lavery, a former chief economist of Merrill Lynch. Higher energy costs will continue to weaken purchasing power for other goods and services, he says.Third, credit problems. As lenders and investors have suffered losses on subprime mortgages -- loans to weaker borrowers -- they've tightened lending standards for other borrowers. With the economy slowing, Diane Vazza of Standard & Poor's expects bond defaults to rise among shakier corporate borrowers, especially companies dependent on strong consumer spending (retailers, fast-food chains, entertainment firms)."

Gramley predicted yesterday that concern about the pace of economic growth in the United States and elsewhere will cause the Fed to continue to ease monetary policy.Gramley, now chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that, if the Japan and West German central banks would agree to a coordinated set of interest-rate cuts, the Fed probably would reduce its 51/2 percent discount rate within four to six weeks. If the other nations do not agree, such a reduction probably still would come within two to three months, he said.As recently as two weeks ago, many financial-market participants seemed to share Gramley's view that the Fed would continue to reduce the discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges on loans to financial institutions. Since then, scattered signs of faster economic growth and new fears about inflation have turned market sentiment around; long-term interest rates, in particular, have been rising.Prior to a rally yesterday, some long-term government bonds had dropped more than six points, with each point representing $10 in market value. Bond prices decline when investors demand higher yields before buying them.Gramley worked at the Fed for many years as an economist and eventually as director of research before becoming a member of the Council of Economic Advisers and then returning to the central bank as a board member."

Only months after state lawmakers in February had to raise taxes and slash spending to close a $42 billion budget deficit, legislators in May will begin work on filling a new multibillion-dollar shortfall.A state agency projects an additional $8 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that ends in July 2010, a result of declining tax revenue amid the recession. The figure could grow if revenue plummets further.And it could get worse yet if voters defeat a series of ballot measures on May 19 aimed at closing the earlier deficit. That is a possibility, as a March 25 poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California shows 50% of Californians against Proposition 1C, which would allow the state to borrow $5 billion against future lottery revenue, versus 37% who support it.The proposition's backers, who include Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders, said they expect increased support for the measures as they begin campaigning. ""As they step back and we get information to them, they'll say, 'You know what, this makes sense,'"" said Republican Mike Villines, the Assembly's minority leader.About $2 billion of the new deficit can be wiped out by using cash reserves that were built into the plan approved in February.

The rate is down from 7.3% a year ago.The same report showed annual average earnings rose 2% in July, a rate that barely keeps purchasing power ahead of inflation and which has varied little since the recession ended more than five years ago.A separate gauge of employee compensation, the Labor Department's employment-cost index, rose in the second quarter. Data released Thursday showed this broad measure of pay and benefits rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% from April through June, its fastest rate of increase since late 2008.Some economists treated Thursday's report with caution, noting the data could include some payback from an unusually weak reading in the first quarter, when the index rose 0.3%.

Both types of bonds threw off the doldrums of 1990, when they had full-year declines of more than 4%.But Treasurys, municipals and other government bonds rose only 2.3% to 4.2% during the first half, using Merrill's yardstick of total return, or price changes plus interest payments.That's not the way the bond market is supposed to behave during an economic slump. The conventional thinking among economists held that the recession would bring down interest rates, wring out inflation and trigger a bond market rally, sending prices of Treasury bonds sharply higher. Junk bonds had been expected to slide further, dragged down by declining corporate profits and rising bond default rates.Instead, junk is starring, and safety is boring."

1,"Dow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- Most Treasurys ended higher on a modest relief rally after the conclusion of two days of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.But analysts viewed yesterday's relative calm as largely a pause after a sharp correction from oversold levels.Last month, yields, which move inversely to prices, fell to historic lows after the Fed in early May cautioned about the risks of deflation. The market rallied strongly through mid-June, in part on speculation the Fed might use unconventional methods, such as buying longer-dated Treasurys, to ease monetary policy if the need arose.But since late June, economists said, Fed officials seem to have tried to respond to what appeared to be a bubble-like appreciation in Treasurys. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, pointed to a statement by the Fed after a policy meeting in late June. ""We've certainly seen the lows in yield"" of this cycle, Mr. Greenlaw said, adding that the selloff in July has ""recorrected"" the Treasurys market back to where it was before deflation talk took hold."

0,"NEW YORK -- The financial markets for weeks have been hoping for an economic slowdown. The economy has been roaring along at a pace that makes analysts worry about a future upsurge of inflation. Some of the statistics suggest that a slowdown of sorts may be under way, but this slowdown is likely to create more problems than it solves.To begin with, it isn't much of a slowdown. The Commerce Department in its flash report last week estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross national product will rise by 5.7% in the quarter ending June 30. At the same time the department revised upward its figure for the first quarter from 8.8% to 9.7%. Going from 9.7% to 5.7% is a slowdown but not an impressive one.The big first-quarter number stemmed largely from inventory-building by businessmen, who had been slow to recognize that an old-fashioned boom was under way. Purchases for inventory apparently have been lower in the current quarter, but little else is slowing down.As usual, high interest rates are beginning to bite into housing. Sales of new homes have declined, and last week the Commerce Department reported that new housing starts declined 10.5% in May. Industrial production rose more slowly in May.Otherwise, a boom seems to be rolling. Edward S. Hyman Jr., an economist at the brokerage firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence, watches a ""revisions index."" Government statistical agencies are constantly revising their numbers on the basis of late information. When the numbers steadily head upward, Mr. Hyman sees a trend toward strength. The numbers on the first-quarter gross national product, in order, were 7.2%, 8.3%, 8.8% and now 9.7%."

0,"The Federal Reserve cited moderating growth when it paused in its rate-increase campaign this week, and concerns about the economic outlook seem to be growing among economists.This month's WSJ.com economic-forecasting survey showed projections for gross domestic product and employment growth were cut, while forecasts for consumer prices and oil prices were lifted. Economists continued to nudge higher their estimates of the probability of a recession over the next 12 months; on average, they put the likelihood at 26%, up from 20% in June and 15% in February.Economists, on average, forecast GDP growth at a 2.8% annual rate for the third quarter, the first time their forecast for that quarter has been under 3% since the economic-forecasting survey first asked about the period in November 2005. While their forecast is slightly above the 2.5% real GDP growth recorded in the second quarter, it is well below the 5.6% growth in the first quarter and average annual growth rate of 3.2% from 2003 to 2005. The economists forecast growth slowing to a 2.6% rate in the fourth quarter, and staying at that rate for the first half of 2007. GDP is the broadest measure of economic output.""The economy has definitely slowed below trend,"" said Ethan Harris at Lehman Brothers. ""Second-quarter GDP is soft, employment numbers are coming in soft and the housing market is finally softening.""Oil prices remained at the forefront of concerns, as 43% of economists -- 20 of the 46 who answered the question -- indicated higher costs presented the biggest risk to their GDP outlook. At the same time, the average year-end forecast for crude-oil prices was lifted to $69.50 a barrel.

0,"Today, the Bush administration and Congress will start squinting their collective eyes at a bunch of proposals to cut taxes on business. They are responding to the fact that the current economic weakness started back with a steep fall-off in business investment. That fall-off has likely accelerated after Sept. 11, and their hope is to produce a tax package that will encourage capital spending.The two hottest ideas at the moment are speeding up depreciation on plant and equipment, as well as a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon:-- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing.Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades. This delay leaves the value of the write-off exposed to twin evils: losses in the time value of money (a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar promised) and losses due to inflation. If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear.If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers. Either way, capital investment would look more attractive to business and, accordingly, more such investment would be undertaken. This could be the start of a virtuous cycle in which more capital formation increases labor productivity that, in turn, raises wages."

The deficit accord still faces hurdles in Congress and hardly stirred enthusiasm in financial markets. The tasks of the central bank, instead of being reduced, may actually have been increased.If the budget pact appears likely to restrain economic growth, the Fed must decide whether to offset it and, if so, how vigorously. An expansionary policy, designed to hold down interest rates, could further weaken the dollar, a prospect that worries at least some Federal Reserve officials. A deeper fall for the dollar could heighten inflation fears -- fears that still are held by some Fed officials.Most economists so far give Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan high marks for the central bank's actions since the stock-market crash on October 19. But some worries are creeping in. The Fed, as promised, flooded the banks with liquidity immediately after the crash, but the period of extreme ease ended quickly. After the first couple of weeks the central bank seemed to seek a more even keel, occasionally pulling reserves out of the banks.The situation is confusing the analysts.

Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually."

Many analysts had been counting on business investment to propel the economy in coming months, now that consumer spending seems to have slowed.

Officials also are preparing to debate whether to fine-tune the Fed's formal assessment of the labor market and the guidance it provides about the likely path of interest rates.""I haven't really changed my view on the economic outlook,"" San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in an interview Friday.He sees the economy growing at a 3% annual rate in the second half of the year and into 2015, the jobless rate continuing to fall and inflation gradually rising to the Fed's 2% goal. ""My baseline forecast implies ending the asset-purchase program on schedule.""The Fed has been buying mortgage and long-term Treasury bonds since 2012 in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy. The Fed said after its September meeting it intended to end the program this month.

However the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, jumped 0.3% last month, the largest increase since June 2008. A 9.3% rise in tobacco prices generated about 40% of the core CPI increase as a federal excise tax kicked in. It was the second-straight month that tobacco lifted the core index.Separately, U.S. industrial production fell 0.5% in April, its 15th decline in 16 months, an indication that businesses continue to draw down inventories in the face of weak demand. Meanwhile, a gauge of consumer sentiment by Reuters and the University of Michigan rose to 67.9 in mid-May, from 65.1 in April.

0,"IT'S TIME for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could now serve both himself and the country if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. Not this week, nor this month, but by fall, he should come to the country with a giant plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the economy, this is an ideal time to strike.Over the past four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe not only transformed his first serious trip overseas but seemed to liberate him from a cautious past. Since then he has put together a string of successes: his deft handling of the China crisis, a clean-air proposal, blockage of a minimum-wage proposal and House passage of most of his S&L bailout plan. A Gallup Poll taken in early June showed his popularity climbing 14 points to a 70 percent approval rating-and that was before his call for cleaner air, a sure winner. After a dangerously slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon.By chance, the president has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in public esteem, badly damaged by the uproar over ethics, pay and unprecedented resignations. While the Democrats have now elected stronger House leaders, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six months ago. Reagan was more formidable than Bush in his first year, but he could never fully reverse the post-Vietnam flow of power away from the White House. Bush just might-if he now moves to set a more ambitious agenda."

McCain suggests that ""the choice is between the right change and the wrong change."" If it's the war that is the focus of all this talk about change, well, that's understandable, and maybe people really do want change. But if it's the economy, it's hard to imagine that change could happen any faster.In fact, the U.S. economy (really, the global economy) is transforming at an absolutely astounding rate. We're living in Internet Time, where policies and their consequences travel the world at the speed of light. The normal human reaction to such a rapid pace of change is to be overwhelmed, stressed out, anxious and fearful. As a result, it is probably true that when voters listen to talk about change, what they really hear are promises of ""no change,"" which would be a huge difference from the status quo. They just want things ""the way they were.""Look at the chart nearby (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ June 11, 2008). America's manufacturing output, as measured by the Federal Reserve, is up seven-fold since 1950, but manufacturing jobs as a share of all jobs have fallen to 10% from 30%. Your grandfather and father may have worked for General Motors (and joined the UAW), but it's likely that you don't and won't.The problem, if it really is one, is not foreign competition or evil financiers. It is technology and productivity. In the 10 years ending in 2007, durable goods manufacturing productivity averaged an annual growth rate of 4.8%.

Advancing shares led decliners, 1,135 to 841, as 129 stocks rose to new highs and 29 fell to new lows.Third-quarter earnings reports indicate that small companies are coping better with the recession than larger ones, Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Claudia Mott said in an interview. Profits among 539 smaller companies surveyed by Prudential are down 0.9% from the year-earlier quarter, compared with a 12% drop among larger companies tracked by the firm.""Small-company profits may be telling us that these companies have been experiencing a recovery,"" Ms. Mott said. She's particularly encouraged by a rebound in earnings among smaller concerns in basic industries such as manufacturing, trucking, mining, chemicals and paper. After two years of anemic earnings, third-quarter profits in that group rose 1.5% from a year earlier and are ahead of expectations, she said. Smaller makers of auto parts, household furniture and other economically sensitive goods also exceeded hopes with a 4.2% rise in third-quarter profits, she added.Makers of consumer staples and healthcare related companies continued to march ahead, with profits up 45.1% and 42.8%, respectively -- but some health-care earnings came in below expectations, she warned.

1,"Disappointing U.S. economic data, new strains in financial markets and deepening worries about Europe's fiscal crisis have prompted a shift at the Federal Reserve, putting back on the table the possibility of action to spur the recovery.Such action seemed highly unlikely at the central bank's April meeting, when forecasts for growth and employment were brightening. At their policy meeting this month, Fed officials will weigh whether the U.S. economic outlook is deteriorating enough to justify new measures to boost growth, according to interviews and Fed speeches.The Fed's next meeting, June 19 and 20, could be too soon for conclusive decisions. Fed policy makers have many unanswered questions and have had trouble forming consensus in the past. Top Fed officials have said that they would support new measures if they became convinced the U.S. wasn't making progress on bringing down unemployment. Recent disappointing employment reports have raised this possibility, but the data might be a temporary blip. Moreover, the Fed's options for more easing are sure to stir internal resistance at the central bank if they are considered.Their options include doing nothing and continuing to assess the economic outlook--or more strongly signaling a willingness to act later if the outlook more clearly worsens. Fed policy makers could take a small precautionary measure, like extending for a short period its ""Operation Twist"" program, in which the Fed is selling short-term securities and using the proceeds to buy long-term securities. Or, policy makers could take bolder action such as launching another large round of bond purchases if they become convinced of a significant slowdown.The landscape for the Fed is complicated by the presidential election. Mindful of his own legacy and the Fed's independence, Chairman Ben Bernanke seems unlikely to allow the political calendar to sway his decisions. He appears especially immune from politics now, with just 18 months left in his term as chairman and little indication that he wants another. Still, some investors speculate the Fed has an incentive to decide quickly to avoid shifting policies close to the November vote."

In the 2004 campaign, Bush has been knocking down such phantoms on subjects from Iraq to free trade.In a speech on May 21 mentioning the importance of integrity in government, business and the military, Bush veered into a challenge to unidentified ""people"" who practice moral relativism. ""It may seem generous and open-minded to say that everybody, on every moral issue, is equally right,"" Bush said, at Louisiana State University. ""But that attitude can also be an excuse for sidestepping life's most important questions.""On May 19, Bush was asked about a plan by his Democratic opponent, Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), to halt shipments that are replenishing emergency petroleum reserves. Bush replied by saying we should not empty the reserves -- something nobody in a responsible position has proposed. ""The idea of emptying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would put America in a dangerous position in the war on terror,"" Bush said. ""We're at war.""The president has used a similar technique on the stump, when explaining his decision to go to war in Iraq in light of the subsequent failure to find stockpiles of forbidden weapons. In the typical speech, Bush explains the prewar intelligence indicating Saddam Hussein had such weapons, and then presents in inarguable conclusion: ""So I had a choice to make: either trust the word of a madman, or defend America. Given that choice, I will defend America every time.""Missing from that equation is the actual choice Bush confronted: support continued U.N. weapons inspections, or go to war."

Those agreements with two small nations are just the overture for a much larger debate involving tariff-cutting deals with Colombia and South Korea. And then comes the monumental question of whether to give President Bush the same free hand that his predecessors have enjoyed in negotiating global and regional trade agreements, not amendable by Congress but subject only to an up-or-down vote.Before last week, there was no chance that a Democratic Congress would trust Bush to look out for the interests of American firms and workers in any such negotiations. Now there is a chance -- but only a chance -- that the United States will be able to take its usual leadership role in moving the world toward an open trading system.What created this opportunity was that after months of saying no, the lead negotiators for the White House, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab finally said yes to the inclusion of labor and environmental guarantees in the body of the trade agreements.Such provisions -- requiring signatories to enforce internationally recognized standards banning child labor and prison labor and permitting union organizing, as well as requiring enforcement of their own environmental laws -- had been included in the final trade agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration and approved by Congress."

But whether the nation's work force continues to prosper and post gains in income and financial security will depend largely on some critical decisions that Congress and the president will make in the coming months.We're in an economic expansion that just won't quit. At 4.3 percent, our unemployment rate is the lowest since 1970, and the lowest of any major country. More than 64 percent of the adult population is working today -- more than ever before in our history. Inflation remains at an insignificant level. Real wages have increased nearly 5 percent in just the past two years. Home ownership is at an all-time high.Since 1990, household financial assets have doubled, and since 1995, the increase in household financial assets for each year was equivalent to nearly one-half of disposable after-tax income for all households. Millions of Americans own stock directly, and millions more own stock indirectly through pension funds. That's a clear sign that Main Street and Wall Street are becoming one and the same.While politicians are quick to take credit for the booming economy, most of the credit belongs to American companies and their employees -- especially the millions of small businesses and self- employed entrepreneurs who take most of the risk, spur most of the innovations and create most of the new jobs in our country.Yet while government may not have created the current expansion, it will have a profound impact on whether prosperity continues and whether on Labor Day in the year 2000 working families are still moving forward or are in a period of decline."

1,"For America's 44 million senior citizens, plus tens of millions of others who are on the threshold of retirement, last month marked a watershed moment that is worth celebrating. At the end of October, the Federal Reserve announced the first step in returning to a more normal monetary policy. After nearly six years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the Fed is ending its bond-buying program and has signaled a plan to eventually begin raising the federal-funds rate, raising interest rates to more normal levels by 2017.U.S. households lost billions in interest income during the Fed's near-zero interest rate experiment. Because they are often reliant on income from savings, seniors were hit the hardest. Households headed by seniors 65-74 years old lost on average $1,900 in annual income over the past six years, according to a November 2013 McKinsey Global Institute report. For households headed by seniors 75 and older, the loss was $2,700 annually.With a median income for senior households in the U.S. of roughly $25,000, these are significant losses. In total, according to my company's calculations, approximately $58 billion in annual income has been lost by America's seniors since 2008.Retirees depend on income from their savings for basic living expenses. Without that income, many seniors have taken on greater risk to increase the potential yield on their savings, or simply spent down their nest eggs. After decades of playing by the rules, putting off spending and socking away money, seniors have taken it on the chin. This strikes a blow at the core American principles of self-reliance, individual responsibility and fairness.Their lost income affects all Americans. Seniors make up 13% of the U.S. population and spend about $1.2 trillion annually -- a big chunk of America's $11.5 trillion consumer economy. In general, seniors spend more than their income, withdrawing each year from accumulated savings, and so their interest earnings get spent right back into the economy."

The strengthening dollar depressed precious metals futures and sent prices for grains and soybeans lower, in anticipation that a strong dollar would continue to hamper farm exports.Political unrest in Lebanon, where the resignation of the Lebanese cabinet Sunday seemed to threaten the government of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel, also encouraged a retreat from foreign currencies to the dollar as a safe-haven investment, an analyst said.Many traders still think the dollar is overvalued. But it may not be clear for several days whether last week's plunge in the dollar was a signal of a continuing dollar decline, or merely a technical correction, analysts said."

But it created potential long-term problems for the battered national treasury, because if the inflation rate rises, the cost of repaying the borrowings could be very heavy.In the second quarter of 1981, British prices rose at an annual rate of 19.6 percent, the highest rate in a year and a sharp increase over the 18 percent figure for all of 1980."

About half the banks said they have widened the spread between their cost of funds and what they are charging borrowers.""Bankers are becoming more cautious,"" said Keith Leggett, economist at the American Bankers Association in Washington, ""but also borrowers are getting more cautious.""About a third of the banks participating in the survey reported weaker demand for commercial and industrial loans, while about one in 10 reported strong demand.

It emphasized that the outlook for inflation -- and not the latest inflation reading -- is now driving its interest- rate decisions. On that score, the Fed reiterated that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.""As widely expected, the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its short-term interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for almost exactly a year.In the accompanying statement, it said, that ""readings on core inflation,"" which excludes food and energy, ""have improved modestly in recent months,"" a more optimistic assessment than at its last meeting, on May 9, when it said ""core inflation remains somewhat elevated.""But it added: ""Sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.

Median family income, the bureau said, thus rose a little over 2 per cent in real terms or purchasing power.At least in part, that unmas clashes with the more familiar stream of statistics the Labor Department has published over the last year, showing wages have risen less than ' prices.Experts yesterday offered several explanations. The Census Bureau statistics measure 1973 as a whole against 1972 as a whole; the Labor Department was measuring what was going on within the year 1973.

The rate on new 13-week bills averaged 5.84%, compared with 6.19% at last week's sale. That was the lowest since Sept. 2, 1977, when similar bills sold at an average rate of 5.554%. The average rate on new 26-week bills fell to 5.93% from 6.17% and was the lowest since a 5.845% rate, also set at the Sept. 2, 1977 sale.Many analysts say government figures to be released this week will show the economy remained weak in the first quarter.

It was the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 1984.Defense spending was flat in the third quarter, despite continuing military operations in Iraq. This spring, defense spending skyrocketed and contributed substantially to the second quarter's 3.3 percent economic growth rate. Late last year and early this year, the economy grew at a weak 1.4 percent annual rate.Fueled by personal-income-tax cuts that became effective in July and a record surge in home-mortgage refinancing that gave homeowners more cash to spend, consumer purchases rose at a very strong 6.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, by far the strongest factor in the overall gain in the nation's economic output, or gross domestic product.

When the nation's unemployment rate dropped to 7 percent, the lowest level in five years, the DJIA bounced 9.86 points but did not carry the broader market.

0,"NEW YORK -- As much as everyone would like to see an endless economic expansion, there are some unmistakable signs that the business cycle may finally be entering its downward phase.No, Asia's currency troubles of recent months are not one of them. Most economists figure the cause and effects of the turmoil in the currency markets may have a modest negative impact on the U.S. economy but won't derail the expansion -- now six and a half years old and the third longest on record.More troublesome, they say, is that for the first time since the end of the last recession in early 1991, businesses are borrowing faster than consumers. The longer this trend persists, economists believe, the greater the chances for a supply/demand imbalance that leaves too many goods and services for too few buyers.""The risk to the economy now is overproduction,"" of everything from bagels to athletic shoes to sports utility vehicles, says Merrill Lynch & Co. chief investment strategist Charles Clough. He is concerned that the unusually high debt burden consumers are carrying has finally prompted them to rein in spending.

0,"NEW YORK -- Hit by a third-straight day of coordinated central-bank intervention, the dollar sank against all major currencies except the pound.The main central banks intervened in each other's markets and staggered their dollar sales, continuing a newly practiced approach designed to extract maximum effect from their actions.But for the most part, foreign-exchange traders said they don't believe the central banks' unrelenting assault has knocked the market to its knees. They said the dollar can't be pushed much lower unless the interest-rate premium the U.S. enjoys over other major countries is trimmed.Also, the sheer size of the dollar's fall this week -- more than seven pfennigs since Friday -- may force central banks to pause to let the market digest the tumble, or their tactics could backfire, traders said.Although many dealers said some revision in central banks' tactics must be near, uncertainty over the potential war chest of new approaches ensures trading remains thin and jumpy. ""You have to use reverse-reverse psychology to figure this thing out,"" said a foreign-exchange manager with a major U.S. bank."

1,"Friday's official report on the U.S. labor market was a contrast with other data suggesting stronger improvement last month. What's behind the disparities?Much of the difference comes down to how the employment surveys are conducted and the problems that stem from producing estimates so quickly after the month ends.The Labor Department's report is drawn from two separate surveys, one looking at workers in households (to determine the unemployment rate, among other measures) and the other looking at payrolls for businesses (to provide figures on job creation). They don't always match up because they are based on different samples, but in the long run they tend to line up fairly closely. The December payroll survey released Friday showed a modest gain of 103,000 jobs. But the prior two months were revised up by 70,000 jobs. The surprisingly weak November figure moved from a gain of 39,000 jobs, as reported last month, to a gain of 71,000 jobs.Why such a large jump in the revision? The estimates for job creation are drawn from a fairly large sample size. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a unit of the Labor Department, samples about 140,000 businesses and government agencies representing roughly 410,000 work sites.But all the surveys don't come back in time for the government to release its initial estimate, usually on the first Friday of the next month. As more results come in, the estimates become more reliable. Labor updates data for the prior two months before considering it final. It also does annual revisions of those figures to account for the creation of new businesses -- a development that is hard to measure during turning points in the economy as companies are shutting down or starting up."

0,"Government Spending Holds Key to GrowthAs goes government spending, so goes the U.S. economy.This is the unpleasant reality a weak recovery and already stretched Federal Reserve have bequeathed. Absent a sudden pick-up in private-sector activity, economic growth in the months ahead will largely take its cue from Congress and the White House. No wonder markets are jittery.For one, the hit from spending cuts across all levels of government has already been a major drag on growth. Indeed, these declines shaved 0.7 percentage point on average from gross domestic product growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Typically, that would be no disaster. Trouble is, this recovery has been unusually weak. So the government cutbacks effectively halved real GDP growth in the first half of 2011, leaving it at just 0.8% annualized.The pace of underlying growth is expected to pick up a bit in coming months. But so, too, is the pace of government spending cuts. A glimpse of this will come Wednesday with the release of July federal budget figures. These are expected to show a third month in a row of year-on-year declines in spending, or ""outlays,"" according to a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. Their estimates show spending is down nearly 12% on average since May from a year earlier."

1,"WASHINGTON -- Reversing a recent trend, consumers' incomes rose faster than their spending in January. But Americans are still reaching for their wallets more than Federal Reserve decision makers would like.Personal income jumped 0.7% last month while consumer spending rose 0.5%, the Commerce Department said. Adjusted for inflation, core consumer spending inched up just 0.3%. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, was unchanged at 0.2%. The savings rate bounced back to 1.4% after hitting a record low of 1% in December.The numbers, which suggest Americans are thinking twice about some purchases, represent an about-face from December when personal income grew just 0.3% and consumer spending surged a revised 1.1%. Core consumer spending climbed 0.9%.The increase in personal income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits, was boosted by pay increases for federal civilian and military personnel, agricultural subsidies, and cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Excluding the special factors, such as a 1.3% rise in government wage expenditures, the largest monthly gain since January 1993, income would have advanced 0.6%.Still, consumer spending, an important driver of the nation's economy, shows few real signs that it's easing up. If January's gain in core spending repeats itself in February and March, spending in the first quarter would increase at a 5.8% annual rate, a hair under the robust 5.9% pace recorded at the end of last year."

How can the financial markets be booming at a time when there is so much joblessness and so much distress in the business community? What is it about the behavior of the markets that turns bad news into good news?	;Perhaps the simplest explanation, and it only scratches the surface, is that investment cycles rarely match the business cycles that bring on recessions.

0,"President Obama didn't comment on Friday's report of declining growth in the second quarter, and that's no surprise.

He's right about the anxiety, but if only we were ""pulling ourselves out.""The reality is that the Great Recession ended three long years ago. In this Less Than Great Recovery, the economy shows promise for one good quarter then slows back down. As the nearby chart shows, this is the third straight year of sputtering recovery. Growth of 4.1% in the fourth quarter declined to 2% in the first and now 1.5% in the second. The stock market rose as investors bet that the lousy growth will inspire more Federal Reserve easing.The sliver of good news is that private growth, which is what really matters, was up a slightly less anemic 1.8%, and government spending fell by a minus-1.4% from the first quarter. Housing is also now less of a drag on GDP. But this makes the paltry 1.5% growth more disconcerting, because it means that other parts of the economy are growing less rapidly than they ought to be.Consumption ticked up only 1.5%, for example, down from 2.4% in the first quarter. This may reflect that wages and salaries are barely keeping pace with inflation. Another negative is that business inventories climbed unexpectedly in the second quarter, which often presages a decline in business spending in the next quarter to clear the shelves."

The slump came despite increased discounts on outgoing 1991 models and even some newly launched 1992 cars.""Consumers are still concerned about lagging incomes, the stubbornly high unemployment rate and the increases in state and local taxes -- all of which have acted to diminish consumers' ability to make purchases,"" said Richard Curtin, who measures consumer confidence at the University of Michigan.Still, Mr. Curtin and other experts agreed that the U.S. economy is in a slow recovery. The weak sales of the period don't necessarily foreshadow a slide back into recession, Mr. Curtin said. ""We see them as a signal that confirms our expectation of a sluggish recovery.""In all, the 10 U.S. auto makers sold 143,480 domestically built cars in mid-August, a 10.7% decline from a year ago. Sales of U.S.-built trucks dropped 10.6% from a year ago to 90,032 vehicles."

William Miller's prediction of an increase in unemployment next year is at variance with the official administration position.Officials such as Charles L. Sehultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, say the economy will grow 3 percent or slightly more in 1979, fast enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising above 6 percent where it has hovered most of this year.Miller said that because of actions already taken to fight inflation and to support the dollar, the economy will grow between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 1979.The projected growth, Miller said, may result in some modest increase in unemployment, but It also provides time to combat inflation without experiencing big increases in demand pressure."

1,"Q Now that interest rates are quite low, we have been exploring the idea of refinancing our 7.5 percent mortgage. Are there costs associated with refinancing? Is there a formula that tells us whether refinancing makes sense?A In recent years, many homeowners have made refinancing almost an annual ritual. Interest rates, which are near an all-time low, have been steadily dropping, and consumers have taken advantage of these lower rates.There are some costs, though, just as there were when you obtained your original mortgage. The only differences between a purchase and a refinance are that there is no buyer or seller present at closing, and no real estate broker is involved.Your refinance lender, even if it is the same lender who holds your current loan, has to start from scratch. The lender must obtain current financial information about you, contract for an updated appraisal of the property and receive an updated title report. Just because everything was acceptable several years ago when you obtained your mortgage does not mean that everything is acceptable today.You should shop around. Contact several mortgage lenders and brokers to determine what interest rates you can obtain. Determine what the various rates will be for a fixed 30-year mortgage, and compare those rates with a fixed 15-year mortgage as well as with an adjustable-rate mortgage."

1,"With the economy expanding smartly, interest rates low and inflation in check, President Bush is sailing into the presidential election year with perhaps only a single dark economic cloud on the horizon: the shrinking U.S. dollar.Whether that cloud produces a nourishing rain shower -- in the form of swelling U.S. exports and a recovery of manufacturing jobs - - or a deluge of rising interest rates and soaring budget deficits is the subject of increasingly heated economic debate.Recent news of rapid third-quarter economic growth, rising consumer spending and climbing personal incomes did little to budge the dollar from its record lows against the 12-nation euro. The dollar has fallen about one-third against the unified European currency over the past three years -- 15 percent this year alone. In the past 23 months, the dollar has slid 11 percent against all the world's currencies, according to Stephen S. Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.For now, economists say, the decline has on balance been a boon to the U.S. economy, pushing the price of American-made goods and services lower on the international market, stimulating exports while trimming imports. Indeed, the economic forecasting firm Global Insight Inc. has calculated that the dollar's decline has saved as many as 700,000 manufacturing jobs since the slide began in earnest two years ago. And as long as inflation stays low, there will be little pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates from their historic lows.But concerns are growing, especially on Wall Street, that the dollar's slide will inevitably drive up long-term interest rates, and some analysts think the decline could even force the Fed to raise the rates it targets. That could slow the nascent economic recovery, swell the already-record federal budget deficit and possibly resurrect an economic problem unseen for nearly 20 years: inflation."
0,"Author: Peter D. SchiffMost economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders ""underwater."" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the ""robo-signing""-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a ""double dip"" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit."

That performance was in sharp contrast to the stock market, where prices surged in record volume. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 13 points to close at 1282.24.Many economists continue to forecast slightly lower interest rates over the next few months because they expect slower economic growth. But numerous investment managers remain leery about long-term bonds, partly because of concern that recent government reports understate the economy's strength. For example, they worry that strong spending by consumers will continue, adding fuel to the economy's expansion and leading to increases in business borrowing.Several major department-store chains yesterday reported large increases in their December sales. In addition, auto makers announced sales gains for late December. Further signs of the economy's health will appear today when the Labor Department announces unemployment statistics for December.

You jump out of an airplane and let your body go into a downward free-fall, trusting yourself to pull the parachute cord at the right time. Everyone who does it says it's fun. But your body is one thing, your net worth something else. And with the market off 5.92% last week, and despite yesterday's 96 point recovery, a lot of earthbound traders are getting aggrieved that Alan Greenspan hadn't pulled the interest-rate cord for them earlier. Now they're worried it's ""too late,"" that inflation is loose and they're headed for a fall.It's not overwhelmingly clear to us that inflation's back. Maybe the wholesale price jump was only a blip. But bond traders, like canaries in a coal mine, are worth watching. There are enough worrisome signs around that this is a good moment to start thinking seriously about what's beyond the economic horizon for the U.S. economy. Robert Mundell, the supply-side economist who just won the Nobel Prize, already has the near term in mind. Interviewed last week he said, ""I don't see any indication of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in the present, but I would not be surprised if that occurred next year.""Now when we say serious thinking about the near term, that includes Presidential candidates who will be running full tilt next year. What if inflation indeed shows up and the Fed feels impelled to tighten, even at risk of a downturn during the election campaign? If the person heading for the White House inherits a stalling U.S. economy, voters will want an answer. The answer isn't, ""I plan to stay within the spending caps."" That's a Beltway thing; it's not an economic strategy.A real economic strategy is aimed at boosting the real economy, whose state of health is anticipated by stock and bond markets. In this world, what one watches are prices, which direct goods and investments to their most productive uses. Inflation disincentivizes that process, and the concern of late is that some relevant prices have been blipping upward.The price of oil, for instance, has more than doubled the past 12 months, owing in great part to the oil-producing nations' ability this time to hang together on prices. They're helped by a number of factors, such as the participation of Mexico. But OPEC's success can also be read as a sign of accommodative monetary policies."
0,"President Kennedy's warning that we face a 7 per cent unemployment rate even without a recession unless we step up our rate of economic growth ought to waken the whole country to the importance of a reduction now in the war-born tax rates that are dragging down the national economy.Tiie consequences of a slow rate of growth become more understandable then staled in human terms of rising unemployment. As the President pointed out, an economy expanding at the rate of 3 per cent is producing jobs at the rate of 10 million in 15 years while the civilian labor force is growing at the rate of 12 million in 15 years. Even with relative prosperity, the result is going to be rising unemployment. The country lost as much by the idleness of those willing but unable to find work in 1962, the President told an audience in Chicago last Saturday, as it would lose from shut-ing down the whole country and suspending all production, services and pay for three weeks. This is an intolerable waste which a civilized state cannot countenance.200.000	jobs a year, from the schools which will put 26 million new young workers on the labor market in the 60s, from automation which is enabling 800,000 fewer workers to produce 20 per cent more manufactured goods.There are many specific projects required to take care of the particular needs of different pools of labor, but none of these narrow approaches will have the total effect on employment that could be achieved by a tax cut of $10 billion which the President has recommended. To attack separately the problem of each idle group, in the long run, will be as ineffective as meeting the problems of a leaky roof with a bucket for each drip. Some of this may have to be done, in areas and age-groups and labor elements with special and peculiar problems that even relatively full employment will not solve. But this is a clean-up job, a mopping-up operation, a bit of social tidying up to be done in addition to raising general employment to acceptable levels.Such benefits as those contemplated in the bill to set up a Youth Conservation Corps and a Home Town Youth Corps for example are only patches on the main problem.

In Europe, borrowing by companies so far in March is already more than 60% of February's totals.""It tells us that financial liquidity is very much on the rise,"" said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. ""No longer do corporations suffer from a dearth of liquidity. This puts them in a better position to take advantage of opportunities that arise.""So far in 2010, U.S. corporations have issued $195.2 billion of debt, excluding government-guaranteed bonds, according to data provider Dealogic, up from $166.8 billion during the same period in 2009. The resurgence of the corporate debt markets comes after a shaky February, when several companies were forced to delay bond sales as worries about Greece's problems sent investors fleeing to safer assets such as U.S. Treasurys. Those concerns have subsided and money is again flowing into corporate bond funds, giving managers cash to invest.Risk premiums, the extra interest corporate borrowers pay over U.S. Treasurys, are falling again for corporate bonds. This allows companies to seize the opportunity to borrow cheaply. The raft of sales point to an increase in economic activity as companies can use the money on new business spending, hiring and mergers. That's good news for companies eager to reduce their cost of borrowing and extend the life of their debt."

They and about 30 other companies in the past few years switched to ""mark-to-market"" pension accounting to make it easier for investors to gauge plan performance.With the switch, pension gains and losses flow into earnings sooner than under the old rules, which are still in effect and allow companies to smooth out the impact over several years.

0,"(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL)By John D. McKinnonWASHINGTON -- Congressional budget analysts gave passing marks to two of the leading plans for restoring Social Security solvency through private accounts, including one proposed by a panel set up by President Bush.The findings by the Congressional Budget Office showed that the Bush panel's plan would produce sharp reductions in benefits by the middle of the century, and also would create huge costs for the government in the meantime, but would eventually put Social Security back on track toward long-term solvency. The analysis, which was requested by several lawmakers studying Social Security's financial problems, suggests that the Bush plan is so effective in reducing benefit costs that backers could afford to ease up a little.Democrat John Kerry's camp wasted little time in attacking Mr. Bush over the CBO report, focusing on the big cost to the federal government of setting aside a portion of payroll taxes to set up the private investment accounts. ""The president is about to start touting his proposal for the 'ownership society,' but the CBO analysis shows it's more like a debt society,"" said Kerry economic adviser Jason Furman. ""Its biggest impact is to increase debt by trillions of dollars . . . damaging our long-run budget outlook."""

Bush actually won, ""his tax proposal may be on the table none too soon.""This has pretty much worked as advertised, except that it's too bad George W. Bush didn't propose a stimulative tax cut.Well of course, the tax proposal President Bush sent to Congress is the same one candidate Bush had on the table in October. And with its attention to across-the-board marginal rate reductions, it certainly was a stimulative one when compared with Al Gore's tax proposal, a hodgepodge of spending programs in drag. But the economic downturn has become much clearer. Perhaps the economy will yet rebound in the second half; leading indicators rose in January after three months of decline, and Friday's employment figures were encouraging. Still, with earnings declines and even layoffs spreading, stimulus soon would be only prudent.The Fed stepped up to the plate by lowering its short-term interest rate target, but the president has made no similar adjustment in his tax proposal. In the current environment, its long phase-in can no longer be overlooked. Experience warns that tax cuts usually stimulate only when they become effective. A phase-in creates incentives to delay income, perhaps making a downturn worse."

The object of reporting is to explain who wins, who loses, why and what it means.The trouble is that politics is not just a game - a series of electoral and legislative contests - but also an expression of national habits and values. Unless these are understood, politics can't be adequately reported. Much political commentary ignores this larger context. Consider a front-page ""news analysis"" in the New York Times on Aug. 1. Titled ""Reagan's Curse on Clinton,"" it attributed Clinton's difficulty in passing his budget to ""the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the political climate he created.""Wrote R. W. Apple Jr., the Times' Washington bureau chief: ""Mr. Reagan successfully argued that government itself was the problem. Most federal programs were bad; taxes were bad; spending was bad... . {The result is that} politicians are terrified to wear that awful label, `tax and spend,' however much their constituents need government money for health care or roads.""Every trend or change must be credited to or blamed on somebody. What's missed are deeper currents in American thinking and society. Reagan didn't create the mood that Apple describes. Americans have always been suspicious of concentrated power, and national government is - for better or worse - now our most powerful institution. Even in 1958, 43 percent of Americans felt that the federal government ""wasted a lot"" of money."

0,"WASHINGTON -- Despite continuing signs of economic momentum, the Federal Reserve still isn't convinced that growth is so strong that it is straining capacity and threatening higher inflation.After a two-day meeting that ended Wednesday, the Fed's policy-making committee voted to leave short-term interest rates unchanged. Whether it tightens rates at its next policy session Aug. 20 -- as many economists expect -- depends on what signals the economy sends on prices and growth in the next few weeks.""There just wasn't enough evidence yet,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm. ""Core prices are still decelerating, and there are clear signs that the burst of strength in the second quarter will slow to a more sustainable level during the second half.""Over the next six weeks, the Fed will get critical new economic data, beginning this morning with new payroll and unemployment numbers. Also due soon are consumer and wholesale prices, retail sales, wages and the first estimate of total second-quarter growth. Many economists expect that number to exceed a 4% annual rate, compared with 2.2% in the first quarter -- well above the level thought to be sustainable without higher inflation, given today's tight labor markets.In their deliberations, Fed policy makers had to look ahead into next year and would have tightened rates if they saw a clear threat of unsustainable growth leading to rising inflation. One factor that may have helped forestall a rate increase was the rising value of the dollar compared with the yen and mark, a rise that will brake the economy by cooling the booming export sector."

0,"NEW YORK -- A weaker dollar and heavy selling by some foreign investors depressed long-term bonds, while short-term securities rose amid continued speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease credit policies.The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 5/8 point, or about $6.25 per $1,000 face amount. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.13% from 8.06% Monday. Meanwhile, bond-equivalent yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.02% from an average of 8.24% at the government's auction on Monday.As a result, the 30-year bonds now yield more than three-month Treasury bills for the first time since May 23. This relationship, in which short-term rates drop below long-term rates, is known as a ""positive yield curve"" and is often viewed as a sign that investors are expecting stable or possibly higher long-term interest rates down the road.If the positive yield curve remains that way, it could also signal that the powerful bond market rally ""may be close to its end,"" said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.The yield curve had been ""inverted"" for most of the past three months.

The Federal Reserve's efforts to keep cash moving in the financial system have stopped short of the sort of interest-rate cut the market craves, but they have weighed on Treasurys nevertheless. The question is how much government bonds will suffer from any turnaround in the credit and stock markets. Friday, the Fed cut the borrowing rate on its discount window to 5.75% and extended the term from overnight to 30 days, with the option to renew. The central bank left the key federal-funds rate untouched at 5.25%.It was enough to prompt a significant drop in prices of long-dated Treasurys. The benchmark 10-year note fell 19.3 point, lifting its yield to 4.673%, as debt prices and yields move inversely. At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.8%.The feeling in the market now is that it isn't so much a question of whether the Fed will cut the fed-funds rate, but when it will do so. According to Credit Suisse, it is a matter of strategy alone; an early cut risks overstepping the mark and forcing an adjustment down the line, with all the attendant volatility and potential damage to the bank's credibility. If credit markets stabilize, the Fed can bide its time and take a more measured approach."

Even if we keep adding jobs at the December rate of 121,000 new jobs, we wouldn't achieve full employment in this millennium.President Obama has urged us to be ""patient"" with this jobless recovery. But it's worth asking how long it will take to get back to the employment levels we experienced before the recession of 2008-09. How patient will we need to be?Consider the math of full employment. We now have a labor force of 153 million people, of whom 14 million are officially counted as ""unemployed,"" defined as not working and actively seeking a job.

The subdued price data came as the Fed opened a two-day policy meeting at which the fate of its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program -- an effort to hold down long-term interest rates and drive up the value of homes, stocks and other assets -- is a central focus.Meanwhile, annual inflation in the euro zone was 0.9% in November, the European Union's statistics office said Tuesday. And central banks in Sweden and Hungary cut interest rates, the latest efforts elsewhere in Europe to boost struggling economies as inflation remains low.The downward pressure on prices presents a conundrum for policy makers across advanced economies: Should they respond with even easier monetary policy or dismiss it as a temporary development?Central bankers worry about inflation falling too low because it raises the risk of deflation, or generally falling prices, a phenomenon that is difficult to combat through monetary policy. Some economists believe weak or falling prices can lead consumers to delay major purchases, exacerbating an economic slowdown. Even without deflation, very low inflation can be a sign of weak demand that weighs on wages, corporate profits and growth."

The federal funds rate is the rate on overnight loans between banks. It remains unclear what effect, if any, that move will have on mortgage rates or other bank lending rates.In the credit markets, short-term interest rates fell slightly after the Fed's action, but interest rates on long-term bonds rose.Chairman Alan Greenspan and other top Fed officials have said recently that the U.S.'s recession may be bottoming out, suggesting that the Fed's attempts to ease credit could end soon. However, Mr. Greenspan also has expressed concern that a ""credit crunch"" is still restricting bank lending and hurting the economy.In the financial markets, many traders seem to share the view that the economy is looking up and that the Fed's campaign to ease credit is all but over.

0,"When stock market investors hear the word inflation, they run for cover -- and often they can find refuge right in their own backyard.Investors have been hearing about inflation a lot lately, and they heard still more Friday. The Labor Department said the consumer price index, a closely watched barometer of inflation, rose 0.4% in March, or at a compound annual rate of 5.1%. Last year, the consumer price index rose just 1.1%.Friday's report only confirmed the accelerating inflation some stock market investors were anticipating a while ago when they jumped into gold stocks, traditional hedges against inflation. But those investors also bid up the average price-earnings ratio of North American gold issues above 50. So, investors who cower at the thought of rising inflation will have to pay dearly if they take refuge in gold.Although some analysts aren't sure the gold stocks are a particularly smart anti-inflation bet at their current prices, the analysts are also uncertain about where else investors can find a haven from inflation.Traditionally, precious metals and commodities have been safe places to park money during inflationary periods.

Last year, almost $20 billion a month in new money flowed into the stock market from mutual funds.But some experts caution that such a huge shift could further pump up stock prices that some already consider inflated, while possibly hurting the bond market.Clinton is proposing diverting 62 percent of an anticipated $4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years to Social Security, then investing less than one-quarter of that amount in the equity markets instead of Treasury securities, in which the fund now invests.Clinton also wants to take another 11 percent of the budget surplus to establish ""universal savings accounts,"" which would be similar to the 401(k) accounts that many employers offer.

Our old zero-sum assumptions - profits and productivity versus the birds and the trees - have given way to a new understanding of the relationships between economics and ecology. ""Doing well"" is increasingly being associated with ""doing good"" for the earth. Conservation is no longer being seen as an inhibitor to growth, but as a stimulus for efficiency. Environmental responsibility is no longer some corporate feel-good issue, but an obligation - to customers, investors, employees, communities and others. To that extent, the notion of ""greener"" companies can be a win-win proposition, with salutary effects for both business and the earth.That's an underlying message from Frances Cairncross, who argues in Costing the Earth that the partnership of clear-sighted economic policies and resourceful companies can survive, even thrive, in the new era of global environmental concern.As environmental editor for the British magazine the Economist, Cairncross has a perspective rooted firmly on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean, where ""government regulation"" hasn't yet earned the same public scorn as ""acid rain."" Her desire to see taxes and regulations realign market signals so as to favor cleaner, greener products and processes is a laudable goal, to be sure, but it may be more at home in the current political climate of Munich, than in Marietta, Ga. Her belief that consumers and producers should pay the true costs of the environmental damage they cause is another worthy ideal, but of dubious practicality in a climate where federal regulators are prone to tiptoe through living rooms and boardrooms, leaving the fewest possible footprints in both."

Companies in Japan are restructuring, instituting layoffs and selling unprofitable divisions, moves they hadn't undertaken before.

Washington's Maryland suburbs have experienced a much sharper increase in nonmilitary procurement than the Baltimore area has.Clinch directed a study, sponsored by eight corporations, of the ability of Maryland's economy to adjust to structural changes and shifts in federal spending.Overall U.S. government purchases of goods and services in the Baltimore area declined by 15.6 percent from 1990, their peak year, to 1993, the study found.

1,"On Jan. 31, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it was lowering the federal-funds rate and the discount rate by one-quarter of 1%. In making the move, the Fed cited the moderation in economic growth and chose to ignore the warning of gold moving above $400 an ounce. As a consequence, the markets have given the Fed a very unsatisfactory grade for its latest rate cut. In the wake of this rate cut, the price of gold has pushed higher to $415 an ounce, long-term interest rates have moved higher, the yield curve has steepened, and the dollar has slipped against the mark and the yen. In other words, interest rates on bonds went up even though the cost of borrowing money fell. Bond investors said, in effect: Pay me more interest to bribe me to own the bonds.A rise in the price of gold is the best signal that we have to indicate that there is diminished confidence about the future purchasing-power reliability of money. The price of gold rises when the most savvy and suspicious investors believe the Fed has become a less reliable guardian of the value of our money. Or they may believe that in our democracy the president or Congress may pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. These suspicious investors would move out of dollars and into gold if they thought that the government was leaning on the Fed to lessen its commitment to price stability.Last week's interest rate cut raises questions about whether it might have been a politically motivated deal. It was unusual that the discount rate was cut by only one-quarter of 1% -- you have to go back to 1978 to see such a small change in the discount rate -- and yet six Fed banks (including all five of the banks whose presidents have an Federal Open Market Committee vote) requested the move. Based on minutes from the Dec. 19 FOMC meeting, there were some members who would have preferred to leave rates unchanged and were unsure, after the rate cut at that meeting, what the direction of the next rate move would be. Where were their voices at the January meeting? Remember, the term of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan runs out March 2, only eight months before the presidential election.On Jan. 31, the Fed ignored the warning signal from the 8% rise in the price of gold above the 1995 average. The Fed effectively said that even though there is some move out of dollars into gold, it will declare inflation to be satisfactory and give another small shove toward growth. Since the discount rate announcement, the price of gold has risen $11, to $415 an ounce; 30-year bonds have fallen two points in price, taking the yield up to 6.17% despite economic data that ought to have been favorable for bonds; and the dollar has fallen two yen, to 105 yen. Why was the immediate response to this monetary policy change so adverse?1. The rise in the price of gold was ignored by the Fed. Standing pat or doing nothing could have achieved a great deal. The Fed could have demonstrated its concern by leaving the funds rate unchanged at 5.5%. If the Fed had not ignored the signal, the suspicions that led to a preference for gold probably would have abated."

1,"The lurching stock market may make consumers queasy, but it's going to take more than that to make them sick enough to trigger an economic downturn.Think back to 1987. Then, the stock market's plunge was much more severe in percentage terms than any of the dips in the past few days. Still, outside of the financial sector, the economy didn't feel any ripple effects until around mid-1989, notes Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.The 1987 market plunge was steeper than any of the market slides that have coincided with recessions in the past few decades. And many economists believe that, to hurt the economy, today's market would have to suffer consistent and considerably worse drops than it has shown recently. Even then, Mr. Fine says, ""only at some future point"" would it damage consumer spending and other economic sectors.In the high-technology sector, where the recent drop has been severe, tumbling stock prices are a reflection of worsening industry performance, said Kenneth R. French, professor of finance at the Yale School of Management. Still, a continued stock price plunge in that sector, he said, might reduce its access to venture capital and inhibit initial public offerings.In general, however, the wider economy is largely insulated from the stock market's volatility. True, more ""little guys"" have their money in the stock market today.

The system expands on and supplants the existing FIPS reports for high-yield bonds.""Trace fulfills NASD's mission to bring greater transparency to debt markets,"" said Douglas Shulman, NASD's president of regulatory services and operations.

0,"NEW YORK -- The dollar's fall on Friday could signal a new bout of weakness for the U.S. currency and -- if it declines much further -- possibly the end of the U.S. currency's long-term climb that began in early 1988.""The entire sentiment has changed; the dollar bulls definitely have been shaken,"" says Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations for Chase Manhattan Bank.He and others cite Friday's plunge in U.S. stock prices and the narrowing difference between interest rates in the U.S. and some of its major trading partners, particularly West Germany and Japan. Many analysts also suspect that the Federal Reserve has begun to reduce interest rates and could go further. Lower interest rates usually diminish a currency's appeal to international investors and speculators.By very late in New York on Friday, the dollar had tumbled to 1.8655 West German marks and 141.50 yen -- its lows for the day -- from 1.9083 marks and 144.17 yen on Thursday.

0,"WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices rose 0.5% last month, the Labor Department reported, a marked slowdown from their 1.1% surge in January but still disturbingly high to a number of economists.A record 18.7% drop in fuel-oil prices helped hold down the overall price level, but a sharp, 3.3% jump in clothing prices kept inflation higher than many analysts had hoped.The department's latest consumer price index, which measures the average change in the retail price of a fixed basket of goods and services, shows that the inflation rate seems to be recovering from a bitter cold-weather shock this winter. In January, catapulting food and energy prices drove the index up 1.1%, its largest monthly increase in more than seven years. The record drop in heating oil prices last month followed a 26.3% jump in January. Overall energy prices fell 0.7% in February after jumping 5.1% in January. Food prices, which soared 1.8% in January after the cold wave destroyed crops, grew 0.5% in February.Many economists said that despite the retreat from January's sharp advance, February still leaves inflation worrisomely high.""I think this shows inflation is a very stubborn problem,"" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

1,"The idea that American manufacturing is on the cusp of a renaissance is everywhere these days -- except in the hard numbers.It's true that industrial production has grown twice as fast as the economy as a whole in this recovery, and manufacturers are adding jobs again. But economists see those gains as too small relative to what was lost in previous years to suggest a full-blown revival. Factories fell so hard, the logic goes, some gains are a given.""There's simply no statistical evidence of a broader renaissance at this point,"" says Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist with the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, an Arlington, Va., group that represents mostly large U.S. producers.Mr. Meckstroth says measures that look deeper inside the sector continue to flash warning signs. Take factory closings. For the past 13 years, the rate factories have been closing has been declining. That's good. The trouble is the rate of openings has been falling even faster. Simply put, America's factories are dying faster than they're being born.To be sure, many U.S. manufacturers are doing better than they have in some time. That's visible in hiring. Manufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs since early 2010, and Monday's report from the Institute for Supply Management is expected to show manufacturers continued expanding in March. But those gains pale compared with the deep hole created during the recession and just before it: U.S. factories lost nearly 5.7 million jobs from 2000 to 2010."

The increase was the first one in three months and was mainly attributable to a rebound in auto sales boosted by dealer incentives. Department store sales declined 1 percent, and sales at clothing stores fell 0.7 percent. Despite the slight gain, sales failed to meet expectations.Business inventories, a key piece of data that economists use to judge the growth of the wider economy, rose for the sixth consecutive month in June to 0.3 percent. Sales at the wholesale level fell for the second month in a row, although the 0.6 percent decline was significantly less than the 1.2 percent drop in May.Consumer sentiment is similarly lukewarm. An index of what they think about the economy by Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan rose to 69.6 in early August from 67.8 in July, which had been the lowest level since November, Reuters reported. Despite the small increase, consumers did not anticipate an improved economy any time soon.Consumer inflation edged up for the first time in four months and slightly above forecasts to 0.3 percent in July, adjusted for seasonal variations, according to the Labor Department. The gain was mainly due to an increase in energy costs. Overall inflation, excluding the volatile statistics for energy and food, rose only 0.1 percent."

0,"NEW YORK -- In the bond market, the wolf isn't at the door. But he is in the neighborhood and headed toward the house.That's the view of many investors who have braced for a Democratic presidency by driving up the long-term Treasury bond yield more than one-half percentage point in two months to 7.76%, the highest since midyear.Looking ahead, economists and money managers expect bond yields to remain flat to higher until after President-elect Bill Clinton announces his economic program. They don't expect any big surge in yields unless Mr. Clinton does something rash -- such as announce a deficit-widening blitz of short-term government spending. They say the economy is so weak that inflation isn't likely to come roaring back soon.""We think that rates could go down or up, but not much in either direction,"" says Ian A. MacKinnon, senior vice president and head of fixed income at Vanguard Group Inc., a mutual fund company.

But the department's survey of households shows that the number of people working has grown about one-sixth as much as the employer survey says. And if the household survey is right, then the work force has not grown as much, and productivity probably has not fallen as much, which is better news for the economy.It's not easy to get a handle on precisely what is happening in an economy undergoing big changes in what businesses produce, how well they produce it and whom they hire to produce it. Reliance on any one statistic may lead to misjudging the height of the forest based on one misshapen tree.Paying too much attention to economic indicators that don't tell the whole story can skew policy, according to Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.

The Fed previously reported a 0.6% decrease for May and a 0.4% gain for April.The Commerce Department said the June increase in retail sales pushed sales to a level 4.6% above a year earlier. The department said the June increase followed upwardly revised gains of 0.7% in May and 0.9% in April.About half of the June drop in industrial production reflected the impact of strikes on output of business equipment, construction supplies and durable materials, according to the Fed. But the board noted that a wide variety of other products also posted declines, with only autos and transit equipment showing significant gains.Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, called the output figures ""anemic,"" and said that ""a very weak industrial sector is starting to drag down the overall economy."" He predicted that industrial output would remain weak as the oil price decline hurts energy-producing regions, manufacturers are battered by overseas competition and businesses hold back capital spending because of uncertainty about tax legislation."

Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports -- though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods."

Consumer spending in January was revised to a gain of 1%, up from the 0.7% gain first reported.In another indication that consumers may be counted on to keep the economy growing, even while manufacturing flails, a widely watched barometer of consumer confidence rose in March after three months of declines.The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index, which measures current and future economic expectations, rose to 91.5 last month from 90.6 in February, according to people familiar with the report. Analysts had expected a lower reading because of the recent stock-market turmoil.But a separate report Friday gave further evidence of the sharp slowdown among U.S. businesses. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that its index of business activity in the Midwest fell to 35.0 in March, its lowest level in 19 years. Any number below 50 signals that business in the manufacturing sector is contracting. Analysts had expected a reading of 43.5, slightly higher than the 43.2 level reported for February.

1,"The dollar remains in heavy demand from banks around the world, a sign trust among banks remains fragile.While a number of indicators show credit markets are thawing, economists, central bankers and investors are paying keen attention to the rate at which foreign banks are pulling dollar deposits out of their U.S. branches. That pace has set records for several months, according to the latest data from the Treasury Department. The moves, analysts say, suggest banks still are scrambling for ways to finance investments in dollar-denominated securities such as U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.Before the credit crisis hit in August 2007, foreign banks could freely borrow dollars from U.S. banks and one another. Bank affiliates also could sell short-term IOUs. Now banks are demanding bigger lending premiums for certain loans.On the bright side, the banks' increased reliance on U.S. deposits is making them less dependent on central-bank lending programs, which were put in place as an emergency backstop. Still, it also demonstrates how brittle the lending markets remain. Until banks develop more trust among one another, even short-term borrowing rates will remain relatively expensive, making economic recovery more costly for businesses and individuals.This has had an unexpected effect on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is supposed to reflect the interest rates banks charge each other for loans. A large gap has appeared between the one-month and three-month Libor, in what analysts say is a worrying sign that banks remain reluctant to make longer-term loans to one another. As of Friday, three-month dollar Libor was 1.01%, 0.59 percentage point more than the rate on one-month loans. Historically the gap hovered close to zero."
1,"WASHINGTON -- The July employment report did little to ease concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to further reduce inflationary pressures. While July unemployment remained steady at 4.3%, hourly wages rose faster than at any time since January, and the economy added a higher-than-expected 310,000 nonfarm jobs. The report appears to bolster the view of those Fed officials who are advocating higher rates -- perhaps another quarter percentage point -- when the policy committee meets Aug. 24.For some Fed watchers, the jump in nonfarm jobs was the most troubling aspect of the report. Most economists had predicted gains in the range of 200,000 to 230,000 new jobs, well below the actual figure.Financial markets flinched at the news. After rising slightly in early morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day at 10714.03, down 79.79.

This movement threatens to obscure the nascent effort, just entering its third year, to help mothers break their complete dependency on welfare through work. It is an effort that could also save money, though that isn't its major purpose.Because welfare developments don't get much public attention, many people may have missed or forgotten the striking series of changes in federal policy designed to reduce welfare rolls by encouraging work.The seminal legislation was the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988. This legislation provided states with several billion dollars over five years to pay for education, training, child care and other services intended to help mothers leave welfare for work including one year of health benefits and day care after leaving welfare.Congress and Presidents Reagan and Bush have collaborated on several other pieces of legislation designed to help promote work. The 1986 tax reform bill eliminated or dramatically reduced federal taxes for low-income workers. The bill also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, an earnings subsidy paid by the federal government to low-income working families with children. In 1990 Congress and President Bush expanded the EITC even more. By 1994, many working families will be eligible for up to $2,400 in cash wage supplements.We have also strengthened the nation's child support enforcement program, expanded federal support for day care and broadened government support for health insurance, all on a bipartisan basis."

Not wanting to be caught arriving late to a rally, the money managers quickly bid up shares of companies whose fortunes are tied to the economic cycle.On Friday, cyclical stocks led the Dow Jones industrials to a record.

Whipsawed by sky-high fuel prices, lower fares and a glut of seats, nine of the 10 biggest carriers by traffic are expected to report fourth-quarter losses. Five did so last week.Distressed airlines typically pin their survival hopes on huge savings from worker concessions. But slashing rank-and-file paychecks creates a management conundrum. Union members want senior executives to share their financial pain. Indeed, the prior heads of Delta Air Lines and AMR Corp. got forced out partly due to union ire over executive sacrifices perceived as inadequate. Yet further curbs on the compensation of the airlines' top brass could push even more of them out of the executive suite.""It's a real tough dilemma,"" says Kim Cameron, a University of Michigan management professor. While profitability and stock prices usually rise when leaders share their subordinates' pay pain, pressure to pinch executive pay harder could weaken carriers' chances for recovery by increasing the tempo of management turnover.""If you pay below market, you get what you pay for,"" says a former vice president of a troubled major carrier who joined a start-up airline earlier this month. ""You will be left with the 'B' team.""As it now stands, virtually no upper-management wallet at sick airlines remains untouched, but the extent of slimmed compensation varies by carrier. Delta's chief executive officer, Gerald Grinstein, skipped his $500,000 annual salary for six months last year. And since he became head of the Atlanta airline in January 2004 (after having been a Delta board member), Mr. Grinstein has taken no other remuneration."

But President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are finding that the old maxim that what goes around, comes around applies to them, too. Less than six months into his term, Mr. Obama's top initiatives -- health-care reform and ""cap and trade"" energy legislation -- are in serious jeopardy and he has himself and his congressional allies to blame.Their high-pressure tactics in promoting and passing legislation, most notably the economic ""stimulus"" enacted in February, have backfired. Those tactics include unbridled partisanship, procedural short cuts, demands for swift passage of bills, and promises of quick results.With large majorities in Congress and an obsequious press corps, Mr. Obama was smitten with the idea of emulating President Franklin Roosevelt's First 100 Days of legislative success in 1933. Like FDR, Mr. Obama tried to push as many liberal bills through Congress in as brief a time as possible.He made a rookie mistake early on. He let congressional Democrats draft the bills. They're as partisan as any group that has ever controlled Congress, and as impatient. They have little interest in the compromises needed to attract Republican support. As a consequence, what they passed -- especially the $787 billion stimulus -- belongs to Democrats alone. They own the stimulus outright.That makes them accountable for the hopes of a prompt economic recovery now being dashed. With the economy still faltering and jobs still being lost, Mr. Obama's credibility is sinking and his job approval rating is declining along with the popularity of his initiatives.

1,"Philips Electronics NV's two-year financial recovery ground to a halt as the company reported an 853 million guilder ($437 million) operating loss for the fourth quarter.The economic crisis in Asia and parts of Latin America, as well as a costly fiasco in the U.S. mobile phone market, took a big toll on Philips's results, reversing a 1.16 billion guilder operating profit in the yearearlier quarter. The loss partly reflects two billion guilders in charges and provisions taken to cover such problems.Reflecting the difficult market conditions, sales fell 6% to 19 billion guilders from 20.3 billion guilders. Net income, however, jumped to 10.32 billion guilders from 2.67 billion guilders, buoyed by onetime gains largely related to the sale of Philips's 75% stake in PolyGram NV to Canada's Seagram Co.Philips warned that it expects to report lower earnings during the first two quarters of this year, while a possible recovery would have to wait until the second half of the year. Philips will ""return to double-digit growth of earnings per share"" in 1999, Chief Executive Officer Cor Boonstra vowed at a news conference in Amsterdam.Analysts said Philips still has plenty of upside potential left. While its entry into the mobile phone market proved disastrous, the company has gained consumer electronics market share in Asia, bolstered its brand name in the U.S., expanded a highly succesful semiconductor business and bolstered its balance sheet by disposing of noncore businesses such as PolyGram."

In its major emphasis, the CED view closely parallels President Eisenhower's economic report to Congress in January. The President's report charted a flexible Government policy for dealing with the business decline, plus, bold long-range moves to strengthen the economy, but said the situation clearly did not require emergency measures.In mid-February, Mr. Eisenhower, in talking to his news conference about increasing unemployment, said his Administration was watching the( situation from day to day trying to make sure no Government move was neglected to keep the country out of a real recession.

Regan indicated the Reagan administration's actual growing worry over the state of the economy, with congressional and state elections only four months away, by publicly pressing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.The central bank, concerned that the economy has shown no sign of a long-predicted second-half pickup, reduced a key lending rate from 6.5 percent to 6 percent, its lowest level since January 1978.Forecasters in the administration, at the Fed and throughout the private economy have been expecting that the nation's output of goods and services would be increasing by now at an annual rate of 4 percent, at least. Instead, many of them think growth in the second quarter was at about a 2 percent rate, and the private economists making public predictions are increasingly saying the remainder of the year may not be much better.During the last two years, the economy has had exactly the same problem: growth has been only half as fast as predicted, 2 percent instead of 4 percent."

1,"One of the great moments from the Starr Report is when Monica Lewinsky earnestly offers the American President her thoughts on education. But that was mere prelude to the federal budget President Clinton unveiled yesterday. Monica may yet be remembered as the face that launched a thousand new federal programs.Congress should call it the Lewinsky budget. The President's proposals for fiscal year 2000 represent a grab-bag bonanza that can only be explained as an attempt to repay the liberal Democrats in Congress who've stood by Mr. Clinton through scandal and impeachment.And what a reward it is: $1.833 trillion in revenue, which adds up to the greatest Beltway tax windfall in American peacetime history -- and all of it to be divvied up and passed around by politicians! The only losers are taxpayers, who under Mr. Clinton's proposal will have to ante up 20.7% of the whole economy to the feds. The era of big government is not over; the President has been born again as a tax-and-spend liberal.Just for reference: Only once this century has the U.S. government sucked up this much tax money, in 1944, when it took in 20.9% of the economy to fight Hitler and Tojo. But just one year later, in 1945, the tax take had fallen to 20.4% of GDP. Mr. Clinton now wants federal taxation to claim more of the economy than it did during the height of the Korean War (19% in 1952), Vietnam (19.7% in 1969) and the Cold War (19.7% of 1981). He is presiding, and intentionally so, over the only peacetime era in American history when taxes have gone up.It's this fabulous rush of revenues -- and not spending cuts -- that is mainly responsible for federal surpluses as far as the eye can see. From 1997 to 1998 alone, revenues climbed by $143 billion, or 9%, triple the rate of inflation. That followed a jackpot increase of $126.2 billion, or 8.7%, from 1996 to 1997."

0,"Higher energy prices, a lousy housing market and tighter credit continue to put the squeeze on consumers -- and Wal-Mart and Home Depot are feeling their pain.Wal-Mart Stores lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast today, even as the world's biggest retailer reported that its second-quarter net income rose 49% to $3.11 billion, or 76 cents a share. The positive quarterly comparison was largely due to a charge in the year- earlier period, and CEO Lee Scott didn't try to hide his disappointment in his company's latest results. ""Our underlying operating performance this quarter is not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,"" he said in a statement. The retail giant said sluggishness in the overall economy contributed to its weaker outlook, but some of the problems are of Wal-Mart's making. Price cuts that opened the key back-to-school season lowered gross margin at U.S. stores by half a percentage point, yet piles of spring apparel remain unsold. Still, executives noted that inventory grew at a slower rate than sales during the second quarter, reversing an issue that plagued the retailer during its first quarter. Meanwhile, the cooling housing market continued to hamper Home Depot's quarterly earnings. The home-improvement retailer saw its net income drop 15% to $1.59 billion, although these results came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company also hinted at the possibility that the proposed sale of its supply business might not go through under current terms. Shares of Wal-Mart fell 5.1%, while Home Depot slid 4.9%.In his conference call, Wal-Mart's Mr. Scott emphasized the financial difficulties crimping the retailer's core demographic of modest-income shoppers. ""It is no secret that many customers are running out of money towards the end of the month,"" he said. ""The paycheck cycle is, in fact, more pronounced now than it ever has been."" Evidence of consumer unease could be seen in the 14% quarterly sales gain Wal-Mart supercenters notched for groceries, whose rock- bottom prices draw budget-stressed consumers. Pharmacy and electronic sales also improved during the quarter. But home-related items and clothing, with their wider profit margins, remained a downer for the retailer. Analysts saw evidence that Wal-Mart executives are taking steps to fix those factors in the company's control, but many remain cool on the retailer's near-term prospects. A.G. Edwards analysts called it an ""ebb tide in low-end consumer spending."" Goldman Sachs faulted ""the tougher macro environment"" for making the company's turnaround ""even tougher to enact,"" and warned of retail-sector fallout from any further price cuts: Wal-Mart's ""efforts to clear inventory could pressure other discounters this holiday season."" And HSBC's note, echoing Mr. Scott, affirmed that the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle means that, for consumers, ""inflation takes a bite out of real spending growth.""In that regard, there was a glimmer of good news in economic data released Tuesday. Despite another jump in energy prices, July data on U.S. wholesale prices were unlikely to stir inflation concerns. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.6%, but the core number that excludes more volatile food and energy prices was up just 0.1% -- slightly below Wall Street expectations. Even more unexpected was Tuesday's trade data: the U.S. deficit narrowed in June due to surprising strength in exports. Growth in U.S. demand for imported goods also slowed slightly, knocking the trade gap down 1.7% to $58.14 billion. The trade deficit from May was also revised downward to $59.16 billion. Strength in the global economy at large, combined with continued weakness in the dollar, helped enhance demand for U.S. exports. Bear Stearns analysts wrote that the trade numbers will likely lead the Commerce Department to revise second-quarter economic growth around 4.3% from an originally reported 3.4%.---"

1,"NEW YORK -- This is a recovery that may need all the help it can muster. The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk. After much restructuring and many plant closings, manufacturers already are using nearly 80% of their capacity."

House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) included it in his recent deficit-reduction proposal.President Barack Obama has in the past signaled openness to switching inflation measures to shore up Social Security. And several centrist Democrats have endorsed the idea, too.But as with much of the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations, nothing is as simple it appears. Even this seemingly technical change has become caught in the ideological gaps between the two sides.Under the Republicans' proposal, the government would stop pegging benefits to versions of the consumer price index that measure the change in prices for a hypothetical fixed basket of goods, the standard measure of inflation. Instead, the government would use the chain-weighted CPI, which tends to rise slower because it recognizes that consumers will buy less of goods whose prices are rising rapidly. For example, if the price of chicken rises more than the price of beef, families might buy less chicken and more beef."

Warburg & Co.But Ford said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects a loss for the just-ended third quarter. Because of economic uncertainty in Europe, and the overall weakness in the U.S. market, Ford said ""losses could extend into the fourth quarter,"" partially offsetting first-half earnings of $840.3 million. However, Ford said results for the full year should ""represent a substantial improvement over 1991 losses"" of $2.3 billion.This week, Allan D. Gilmour, who heads Ford's world-wide automotive operations, said the company remains committed to its aggressive product development programs despite economic weakness in the U.S. and in Europe, where Ford expects a loss for the year.""In spite of these weak markets, particularly in Europe, Ford is maintaining its aggressive commitment to invest the resources to bring to market good cars and trucks, and to develop practical, functional technology for these new products,"" Mr. Gilmour said in a speech at the Paris auto show."

The percentage of Americans 65 and over with poverty status dropped to 9.9% from 12.8%.The information, some of the most detailed yet from the 2000 Census, was compiled from long-form questionnaires that were given to roughly 17% of all U.S. households. They offer a glimpse into a variety of demographic trends, including the types of jobs people have, their education level, and how many cars they own.Short-form data, released last year, pertain mostly to population counts, housing and race. The long-form data show, for instance, that homes where only English is spoken dropped to 82.1% from 86.2%, while the percentage of Americans with a bachelor's degree or higher rose to 24.4% from 20.3% a decade earlier.The new income data show that poverty rates fell in parts of the South and the Midwest, though many rural areas continued to be some of the poorest communities, according to an analysis by the Associated Press.

1,"NEW YORK -- As bond investors return from the holiday, they still have memories of Friday's pleasant kickoff, when bonds went through the roof as investors cheered upbeat economic news. But some analysts say the rejoicing may be out of place, because the jury is still out on the Fed's next move.The price spike on Friday, the last trading day before today, was triggered by bond-friendly employment news, which eased fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. The Labor Department reported that 124,000 nonfarm employees were added to the nation's payrolls in August, a little less than half of what Wall Street had been expecting. The unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.3% in August.Meanwhile, average hourly wages increased just 0.2%, comforting investors worried that rising wages will lead to higher inflation.The news sent bond prices climbing.

0,"WASHINGTON -- There are roughly 600,000 more Americans out of work and looking for jobs than previously believed, the Labor Department said.Major changes in the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics tallies the number of jobless workers have given department officials a better handle of how many people are unemployed, and there appears to be several hundred thousand more of them.The result is that the high-profile unemployment rate will very likely bump up by half a percentage point when the changes -- which involve asking better-crafted questions and using a computer instead of a pad of paper to record survey answers -- take effect in January. The first employment report under the new system will be issued Feb. 4.If a higher unemployment rate is reported as a result of the agency's changes, it wouldn't mean the economy has suddenly gotten worse. It would indicate, however, that the department has been consistently underestimating the number of unemployed people. October's unemployment rate, the latest figure available, rose to 6.8% of the work force, putting the jobless total at about 8.8 million people.Such reworking of statistics, though, often confounds policy makers who find they have been making decisions based on one set of assumptions, only to find that a different picture is more accurate."

0,"IF YOU LISTEN to Milton Friedman and more and more economists and official!' today arc doing so he will tell you that, fiscal policy (the level of tax and spending totals) is unimportant.

Taking the two years together, that was a net toughening of fiscal policy by $28.3 billion.But we know now that it didn't, even with an extension of the surplus to a projected $5.9 billion in fiscal 1970.Why? Because, Friedman will tell you, whatever anti-inflationary effect the surcharge had, it was more than counter-balanced when the Federal Reserve decided in mid-1968 that the money supply had to be expanded to prevent overkill. It was one of those classic, egregious mistakes on which the Federal Reserve seems to own a patent."
1,"The job market recovery continues, sort of, though what it gives with one hand it takes away with the other. In Friday's Labor Department report for November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.7% from 7.9% in October, but mainly because another 350,000 workers disappeared during the month.Call it the case of the missing workers. In the last year, employers have added an average of about 150,000 workers a month. In November they added 146,000, less 49,000 in downward revisions for the previous two months. Hiring grew at a healthy pace in professional services, leisure and hospitality, while falling slightly in construction and manufacturing.Yet even as payrolls are rising, albeit slowly, the overall labor participation rate has continued to fall. In November, the share of the available labor force that is working fell to 63.6%, which is down from 65.7% when the recession ended in June 2009.Mull that one over: Three years into an economic expansion, the labor participation rate has fallen two full percentage points and three times this year (including November) it has reached the lowest level since 1981. This means that about three million more workers were working or looking for work in 2009 than in November. In the last year alone, the number of working age nonworkers grew to 89.2 million from 86.8 million.So why are more Americans sitting on the labor market sidelines even as job opportunities expand? One popular suspect last month is Hurricane Sandy, yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded that the storm ""did not substantially impact the national employment and unemployment estimates for November."""

But this year, there are some significant differences, triggering concerns that prices could be headed higher and that the economy could be vulnerable.One main distinction: This time around, the economy isn't looking quite as healthy amid concerns about the weakened housing market and mortgage defaults.In addition, in 2006, oil inventories were higher because of market incentives to store oil, which meant energy buyers had a stockpile. By contrast, today, different market incentives have led to much lower oil inventories in key regions.That's troublesome, because the lack of a stockpile cushion means that any supply crunch could lead buyers -- oil refiners and speculators alike -- to quickly bid up crude-oil prices beyond $80 a barrel, just as the economy appears vulnerable to recession."

1,"Even as the U.S. job market has improved, companies have been slow to pay workers more. But they may now be approaching the time when they have to cut bigger paychecks to compete. What's more, they appear to be getting ready for this.The unemployment rate has been falling swiftly, dropping to 6.3% in May from 7.5% a year earlier. But there's an open question about how much slack there is in the job market. Some 37.2% of the working-age population is out of the labor force now, compared with 34% when the recession started in 2007. And while some of those people lost to the labor pool will likely return, some, such as those nearing retirement age and those whose skills have eroded, may never come back.At Wednesday's news conference following the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting this week, Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that for her, an important sign the labor market is tightening will be when wages are increasing more rapidly. So far, that hasn't been happening. Average hourly earnings were up just 2.1% in May versus a year earlier, and the Labor Department on Tuesday reported that, when adjusted for inflation, they were actually a shade lower.But companies think they will soon be paying more. This month, a quarterly survey conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine showed that U.S. chief financial officers expect wages and salaries at their companies to increase 3% over the next 12 months. Last June, they had expected year-ahead gains of 2.5%. Further, they now expect their workforces to increase 1.9% versus 0.8% a year ago.That leaves the little matter of how companies will pay for those bigger, more expensive workforces."

Congressional Republicans have the same outlook. The deficit is up thanks to government spending, so we must cut spending right now in every form.Yet the long-run fiscal problem facing the country--which is real--has almost nothing to do with the reasons that the deficit is currently large or that spending is abnormally high. They are high for the same reason taxes are abnormally low: because of the economic downturn. We should debate the real issues, not try to pretend the recession never happened.The Congressional Budget Office forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit before the Obama administration even came into office.

1,"WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department, in predicting a fifth consecutive year of economic expansion in 1987, expects a significant narrowing of the nation's trade deficit.In its annual Industrial Outlook, a detailed analysis of 250 goods-producing industries and more than 130 service-sector industries, the department forecasts that about 70% of U.S. manufacturing industries will record increased shipments.At a news conference Wednesday, Deputy Commerce Secretary Clarence Brown said the department's most optimistic forecasts estimate that the merchandise trade gap could narrow by as much as $40 billion this year.The deficit in 1986 is believed to have swelled to as much as $170 billion, and many private economists anticipate less improvement in 1987 than Mr. Brown suggested. In a separate report released yesterday, the department said the nation's merchandise trade deficit expanded to a record $19.22 billion in November.Mr. Brown said manufactured exports are expected to grow faster than imports for the first time since 1980. The improving trade balance, he said, is due to the dollar's decline against major foreign currencies, U.S. efforts to encourage more-balanced growth and trade-liberalization abroad, and strict enforcement of U.S. trade laws."

With slowing housing demand, Wall Street thought that would make it easier for the Fed to stop raising rates soon.A surge in big-ticket factory orders raised questions, however, about whether demand would hold steady, possibly increasing pricing pressure and the chance for higher inflation. The Fed meets Monday and Tuesday, and it is expected to raise the nation's benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent.While questions remain as to how many more rate increases the Fed will implement, analysts believe stocks still have room to move higher, thanks to a decent economy and the chance for another quarter of strong corporate earnings.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.68, or 0.1 percent, to 11,279.97.

But now that air travel has been hobbled by security fears, sharply reduced visits by vacationers and business travelers have dimmed those economic bright spots.A few regions may weather the storm better: oil-producing economies such as Houston and Louisiana; defense-contracting strongholds such as Southern California and northern Virginia; and areas where displaced Manhattan firms are setting up temporary or permanent offices, most notably New Jersey, which could gain as many as 100,000 jobs.Still, few places, if any, will escape unscathed.

But prices have risen just as much in the six months since August, about when the recession began, as in the six months before. Some economists say that slack commodity and labor costs and unused capacity at factories will keep inflation in check. As Samuel D.

1,"If the welfare debate has a familiar ring, it's because the language of block grants, state flexibility and innovation was part of a discussion more than a decade ago about how to save on social spending.In 1981, the Reagan administration successfully pressed Congress to trim Title XX of the Social Securities Act, a program that helped focus spending on child day care, home-based nursing and other social programs. The fix: Lump the money and turn it over to states as block grants with few strings attached.But instead of leading to the renaissance supporters had pictured -- with savings and improved services -- the changes reduced funding and forced localities to trim some programs, social workers now say.Welfare experts say the changes to Title XX provide one of the best parallels to reforms designed to end Aid to Families with Dependent Children. ""It's pretty much the purest form of block grant that people are talking about,"" said Michael Kharfen, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman.One of the strings cut in Title XX was the requirement that states supplement federal grants with their own money. Some states responded by curbing spending. Dropping the requirement for state supplements paralleled the effects of inflation, so while the total federal block grants rose to $2.8 billion last year, the grants' value has fallen by 58 percent since 1977, according to a House Ways and Means Committee report."

The disappointing jobs number continues a string of dismal data that stretches back to February, prompting intensifying discussion about whether the economy is going into another prolonged funk.But measuring the economy's strength during a time of war, especially one that could end sooner rather than later, is tricky business.

Economists are busy sorting the ""temporary"" effects of war from more durable indicators to try to determine what kind of growth to expect this year."
1,"Most commentators have concluded that stock prices were so high in August that they inevitably brought about a crash that ended the bull market. The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end. But the reasons to doubt the current bear-market consensus go beyond that line of analysis."

The 2009 forecast was slashed from 3.9% to 3%, which would be the weakest level since 2002 and near the threshold of what the IMF considers a global recession.While the IMF still expects a recovery to begin late next year, it warned there are ""considerable downside risks"" to that scenario, which assumes U.S. and European governments will succeed in their efforts to stabilize markets."
0,"WASHINGTON -- Last week's economic data provided a vexing picture of an economy in which industrial managers have slammed the brakes on production because of recession fears, but where inflation hasn't slowed as quickly as might be expected in a downturn.That combination means trouble for policy makers who want to jump-start the economy with lower interest rates, but worry that lower rates could also stimulate inflation.Industrial production in November plunged 1.7%, following decreases of 0.9% in October and 0.1% in September, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The November cutback was the biggest in a single month since production dropped 2% in January 1982.A 21.5% drop in auto and truck production, along with declines in other areas related to car manufacturing, accounted for more than half the loss in the month. Businesses also shut down a big chunk of productive capacity; industry operated at 80.9% of capacity in November, down from 82.4% in October. The November rate was the lowest since May 1987.In another report, the Labor Department said producer prices increased 0.5% in November, about twice what many economists had expected given recent statistics pointing to a clear economic downturn in October and November."

The revision put GNP growth at a modest 2% annual rate, up from the 1.7% rate calculated in July. The Commerce Department said the upward revision mostly was due to a larger-than-expected rise in inventories during June.The revised second-quarter productivity gain is based on a 2.2% increase in non-farm output and a 1.2% increase in hours worked. The earlier estimate was based on a 1.9% increase in output and a 1.4% increase in hours. All the figures represent seasonally adjusted annual rates.The latest productivity figures continue a pattern of peaks and valleys that characterize economic growth in the later stages of an economic cycle. Productivity generally rises sharply in the early stages of a business recovery and then tapers off as employers hire more workers. Productivity spurted at a 7.1% annual rate in the 1983 second quarter.

The number of weeks could be reduced, however, if the national unemployment rate, currently 7.5%, drops below 7% for two consecutive months.The finance panel's plan is far closer to administration proposals than the version passed Tuesday by House Democrats. The House bill would offer up to 26 weeks of emergency jobless benefits. Both jobless packages, however, face administrative opposition.The $5.4 billion cost of the legislation approved yesterday would be covered by eight tax-raising measures. One provision would require securities dealers to pay taxes on the year-end market value of their portfolios, rather than on the value at purchase. Another provision would bar new owners of failed thrifts from deducting losses for which the federal government has compensated them since March 4, 1991, a practice known as double-dipping.Both of these tax provisions were part of President Bush's budget proposal this year. Another measure would require large corporations to pay their quarterly taxes based on 96% of their estimated yearly income, up from 95%."

The Economist of April 18 counters with a picture of a balloon, the headline, ""America's Bubble Economy,"" and the message that the stock market is headed for a crash, imminently.The Dow Jones industrial average falls 103 points from April 20 to 24 -- only the second weekly decline since Jan. 9. Then, on Monday, after news that the Federal Reserve Board might raise interest rates, the Dow drops 147 points.Looks like trouble, and the newspapers are full of stories about analysts predicting a slide. But later in the week, the Dow bounces back by more than 200 points after reports that economic growth is strong and inflation nowhere in sight -- except perhaps in the stock market itself.All the blather about the stock market being too high (or too low), about bulls and bears, about the latest GDP and CPI -- it's extraneous noise. Certainly, you should be alert to specific opportunities in individual stocks, and the economy and inflation sometimes influence the chances of, say, auto stocks or bank stocks that might be depressed.But what investors need to remember about the market as a whole are the simple things: In the short run stocks are wildly volatile, but in the long run they are no more risky than Treasury bonds and money market funds. If you need your money in the next seven years, you have no business putting a significant portion of your wealth in the stock market. If you can keep your money working for the long term, it makes sense to be in with both feet -- as long as you can sleep at night."

Traders who sell securities ""short"" borrow shares and then sell them, betting they can profit by buying the stock back later at lower prices.Short interest reflects the number of shares that haven't been repurchased for return to lenders. Aside from making negative bets, investors may rely on short selling for other purposes, such as a hedging strategy related to corporate mergers and acquisitions, for convertible securities and options, and for tax purposes."

Indeed, many economic policy entrepreneurs say they are writing off the next two years and instead are concentrating on ideas that will resonate in the 2000 presidential campaign.Equally vexing, however, is that policy proposals being debated in both political camps seem as likely to highlight intra-party differences as to draw clear distinctions between Republicans and Democrats.White House economic advisers, reflecting President Clinton's interest in securing his legacy, are pondering long-term challenges -- how to boost productivity through improvements in education, for example, or how to ensure lasting solvency for federal entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

1,"WASHINGTON -- Economic conditions are improving in most of the nation, but the rate of gain continues to be relatively small and uneven, according to new surveys by the 12 Federal Reserve district banks.Overall, 10 of the districts, in their report for November, noted slight to moderate gains in some or all sectors of the economy. Retailers in particular said activity had picked up in October and early November, and many were optimistic about the current holiday season. The Chicago district went so far as to call it ""the best performance in eight years.""Badly battered consumer confidence also seemed to be on the mend in many areas, a trend that respondents in Boston and Chicago linked to the end of the presidential election campaign. In New York, however, retailers attributed the somewhat brighter picture to promotional efforts rather than to any meaningful revival in the economy.Manufacturers in about half of the Fed districts said things are looking up, albeit generally quite modestly. Ongoing cutbacks in the defense industry remain a drag on the recovery in some regions. And while indicators from Dallas are strong, and Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago reported small gains, many industrial concerns in the New York district and California continue to experience weak demand.Construction and real estate remain ""a tale of two markets,"" the report said, with improvements in the residential sector and continued stagnation on the commercial side. In Southern California, for example, some commercial rents have fallen 25% to 40%, and forecasts for next year show rents tumbling an additional 10% or more; the number of foreclosures is expected to rise."

0,"IT WAS BOUND to happen when the full force of the recession hit the pockets of this region's governments, but today there is even more evidence that budget pressures are threatening to destroy Metro, the Council of Governments and other important city-suburban institutions, While some of the effects might not be felt immediately by the public, breakdowns in bus service, higher costs of transportation, delays in road projects and other costly setbacks could occur if disputes between the local governments aren't resolved soon. Metro: The Metro board has ordered General Manager Lawrence G. Reuter to cut District bus service and raise fares if the city does not pay the transit agency the $18 million that it owes by Feb. 1. This isn't a new dispute. In fact, the current city administration has been relying on delays in Metro payments to help balance its annual budget books on paper if not in reality. This week, as they have done in the past, the regional board members agreed to allow Mr. Reuter to borrow money to pay Metro's bills including its payroll until the District government pays its full, agreed-upon share, plus interest.If that doesn't happen, the options Mr. Reuter is considering are shutting down night and weekend bus service in the District; eliminating any bus routes that duplicate rail routes; ending discount fares for schoolchildren; raising the fares for the elderly and disabled from 30 cents to 50 cents; and increasing special 35-cent fares on Anacostia buses to 60 cents.Some of these economies may have to be made even if the city pays its current bill, given the staggering budget problems already confronting a government in transition and under strict congressional orders. But mass transit in the city is not a designated charity for suburban taxpayers. There is enough friction within the partnership already, with participating governments re-- placing Metro bys service on certain routes with V buses run by Tither operators. While this may yield some savings for the individual governments, it tends to raise overhead costs for the remaining regional bus and rail services.

Recent reports on economic growth and orders for capital equipment, among other things, pointed to a possible slowdown and contributed to recent volatility in the stock market.Bolstering the outlook further: The monthly U.S. trade deficit fell nearly 3.8 percent in January, to $59.12 billion.

Some analysts were surprised by the high level of demand, given widespread worries that many investors, such as institutional buyers from Japan, might have better investment opportunities at home.Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities International, estimated that Japanese investors, reportedly urged on by their central bank, purchased 30 percent to 40 percent of the notes.

To show the dimensions of these investments, principally American, between October 1955 and March 1957, net direct investments amounted to Canadian S639 million; net new security issues amounted to Canadian $701 million; trade in outstanding securities amounted to Canadian $300 million; other capital flows amounted to Canadian $390 million.

Similar but small reductions characterized the rate changes for 1955-56, introduced when the extent and timing of the economic recovery was still unknown.

""If we stay at these very elevated prices, we are going to see some erosion in a number of macroeconomic variables.""The Fed is already worried about the sluggish pace of economic growth and the risk that low inflation, excluding energy prices, could turn into deflation.

A number of FOMC members indicated that they expected to have to boost interest rates again in the near future to slow economic growth enough to head off rising inflation.A majority agreed that it ""would be acceptable"" to make cash less readily available to the banking systems in the weeks following the meeting, ""depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets.""On the other hand, making cash more readily available ""might be acceptable,"" depending on economic developments, the Fed statement said.Even that tilt toward a tighter policy and higher interest rates was not strong enough for Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, one of the 12 voting members of the committee.

One possible option is to take equity stakes, such as buying preferred stock, under terms that are favorable to the institution.While details are still being discussed, the program would most likely be voluntary and aimed at encouraging healthy institutions to participate. Under one scenario, banks could come to Treasury and ask for an injection rather than having Treasury determine which banks would get an infusion.

1,"Evidence of declining consumer demand keeps mounting, even amid upbeat economic developments.Major U.S. manufacturers, despite high energy and raw-material costs, are continuing to see firm growth in orders, aided by the weaker dollar and the continuing move to replace equipment bought during the investment boom of the 1990s.The strength is visible more among capital-goods producers and less among consumer-oriented manufacturers. Furniture makers and others in the latter category are seeing the impact of slowing job growth, a decline in consumer confidence and low household savings rates. Indeed, noticeably absent from the rosy projections are auto makers and their suppliers, who have cut expected profit and production plans.At the same time, U.S. business inventories rose in February, expanding 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $1.288 trillion, while sales fell 0.4%, the steepest decline since April 2003, the Commerce Department said yesterday.Combined with the reports earlier this week of a record February trade deficit and disappointing March retail sales, the data added another indication that America's 2005 economic growth may be weaker than the gradual slowing many economists have anticipated from last year's 4.4% pace."

For the full year, analysts widely predict that labor costs will rise less than the 4.4% increase of 1991.Many inflation optimists peg their good mood on wage costs. ""With nominal wage increases gradually easing . . . the odds of seeing a further gradual reduction in the core rate of inflation are quite favorable,"" says Federal Reserve Board Gov.

Some contend that the economy is so weak that the Federal Reserve System will cut interest rates within a month or two in an effort to prevent a recession.But many other analysts contend that the Labor Department figures will indicate that the economy is continuing to expand at a moderate clip and that the Fed doesn't need to provide additional stimulus.

While that would be a record, exceeding the previous year's $269 billion deficit, it's far below the $368 billion that the Congressional Budget Office originally had forecast. The White House budget office once had assumed that the gap would be even greater: a mammoth $399 billion.Still, analysts say the surprising improvement for 1992 could prove to be short-lived, and they expect enormous deficits for the foreseeable future.Last summer, the CBO and White House pared their deficit projections to $314 billion and $334 billion, respectively -- mostly to reflect delays in deposit-insurance spending for the savings-and-loan cleanup.But in the short time since those revisions were made, the government has taken in more revenue than it thought it would, while spending has been somewhat less.

The Bush tax cuts, he says, could actually be making the recession worse.To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits ""as far as the eye could see"" thereafter.Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election.Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point: It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession. Mr. Reagan, bless his stubborn heart, agreed with his treasury secretary and, as he put it, ""stayed the course.""Sure enough, the economy didn't just recover -- it boomed. Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined.

0,"Consumers aren't stepping up spending at the pace many retailers expected just a few months ago, raising the specter that stores will be stuck with piles of unsold goods later this year.This dimming retail picture is part of a larger downshift in growth occurring across the economy. Consumer confidence slumped last month and the job market remains weak. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported consumer borrowing fell in May, another sign that they are wary about their finances.All this bodes poorly for the kind of snapback in spending many stores anticipated only a few months ago. Last year's holiday sales were strong and many retailers expected robust growth to continue through this year, fueled in part by pent-up demand for washing machines and clothes that weren't bought during the recession.The typical retailer has to place orders four months or more in advance of actual sales -- which makes them susceptible in the event that sales fail to materialize or simply grow much more slowly than expected.Slower growth could mean stores will be stuck with excess inventory.

And it has worked, at least for now.The trillion-dollar question for the economy now is: What will happen when those government supports are gone? While the government has successfully jump-started the U.S. economy, there are emerging signs that its engine still isn't running very well, and may even sputter out.The government has deployed about half of $787 billion in spending and tax cuts that were part of its stimulus package. It has executed the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program that boosted auto sales over the summer, and it has taken a wide range of steps to support the housing market. The Federal Reserve, besides cutting its target interest rate to nearly zero, has committed $1.75 trillion to unconventional programs meant to reduce interest rates.The combined results of all those efforts will be on display Thursday, when the Commerce Department reports on gross domestic product for the July through September quarter. Economists expect that broadest measure of economic activity to have risen at a 3 percent annual rate, compared with a 6.4 percent drop in the first quarter, and forecasters expect growth to continue through year's end.""The patient is out of intensive care, but is still highly medicated,"" said David Shulman, senior economist at the UCLA Anderson Forecast.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit an all-time high of 392.08 in intraday trading before ending up 1.60 to 389.62, a little more than one point off its closing record. But small stocks burst decisively higher, driving the Nasdaq Composite Index up 4.40 to 514.40. That eclipsed the previous record of 511.31.Traders said the stock market rally was prompted by rising bond prices that drove long-term interest rates sharply lower. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, for example, gained more than a half a point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount, driving the yield on the issue down to 8.16%.The trading day started with the Commerce Department reporting that July retail sales rose 0.5%, considerably stronger than the 0.2% that many traders had expected. Bond prices dropped on the news, which implied that the economic recovery remains intact and could eventually spawn higher inflation. Stock prices followed bonds lower.But traders said that at midmorning, one or more big institutions began aggressively buying longer-term government securities, seeking to grab the significantly higher yields available on seven, 10 and 30-year notes and bonds. The demand for longer-term notes and bonds drove prices up. And as bond prices rose, stocks followed, spurred on by computer-guided buy programs. While bond prices held their gains, late in the day many stock traders took profits, costing the market much of its earlier gains."
0,"WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department trimmed its estimate of the economy's fourth-quarter growth rate to a sluggish 1.3% annual rate from the 1.7% reported earlier.The weak fourth-quarter expansion in the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services -- followed growth at a 2.8% rate in the third quarter. For all of 1986, the economy grew at a 2.5% rate.Several economists asserted that the new report suggests the economy is poised for a pick-up in growth. The revision occurred largely because the department found that nonfarm inventory investment was lower in the fourth quarter than originally reported.""The story is the big decline in inventories and what that implies for the first quarter,"" said David Berson, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia, who predicted that businesses will rebuild inventories in the first quarter. He said Wharton is likely to boost its estimate of first-quarter growth to 3.2% from 3% as a result of the GNP revision.Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said, ""It seems to me that while the fourth quarter was less than expected we were better positioned as we headed into 1987."" In addition to the inventory revision, he said, the new report showed that demand was stronger than indicated earlier."

But the Lone Star state lags a bit when it comes to its spending on tomorrow.That's according to the fourth edition of the American Electronics Association's ""Cyberstates: A State-by-State Overview of the High-Technology Industry."" The report, which is being released today, takes a number of different measures of the state's high-tech industry -- including its employment, wages and share of exports -- and compares them with those of other states, as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The report, funded in part by the Nasdaq Stock Market, also provides an analysis of both high-tech venture-capital investments and research-and-development expenditures.The association defines high tech using three broad categories: manufacturing, communications services, and software and computer-related services. The definition doesn't include such fields as biotechnology or aerospace.In high-tech employment, the Lone Star State ranked high: For every 1,000 private-sector workers in 1998, 56 were employed by high-tech firms, or 22% more than the total U.S. share of high-tech employees. That placed Texas 11th in the country in terms of that concentration -- behind such states as California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Colorado had the highest concentration of high-tech workers (84 for every 1,000 private-sector workers), while Wyoming ranked last, with 14.The number of high-tech employees that Texas hired grew by a healthy 48%, compared with the national average of 28%, placing Texas 10th.

The Obama administration's budget projections claim that raising taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, those individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning $250,000 or more, will increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. None of the personal income tax or capital gains tax increases enacted in the post-World War II period has raised the projected tax revenues.Over the past six decades, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged just under 19% regardless of the top marginal personal income tax rate. The top marginal rate has been as high as 92% (1952-53) and as low as 28% (1988-90). This observation was first reported in an op-ed I wrote for this newspaper in March 1993. A wit later dubbed this ""Hauser's Law.""Over this period there have been more than 30 major changes in the tax code including personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, investment tax credits, depreciation schedules, Social Security taxes, and the number of tax brackets among others. Yet during this period, federal government tax collections as a share of GDP have moved within a narrow band of just under 19% of GDP.Why? Higher taxes discourage the ""animal spirits"" of entrepreneurship. When tax rates are raised, taxpayers are encouraged to shift, hide and underreport income. Taxpayers divert their effort from pro-growth productive investments to seeking tax shelters, tax havens and tax exempt investments. This behavior tends to dampen economic growth and job creation. Lower taxes increase the incentives to work, produce, save and invest, thereby encouraging capital formation and jobs. Taxpayers have less incentive to shelter and shift income.On average, GDP has grown at a faster pace in the several quarters after taxes are lowered than the several quarters before the tax reductions. In the six quarters prior to the May 2003 Bush tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 1.8%. In the six quarters following the tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 3.8%. Yet taxes as a share of GDP have remained within a relatively narrow range as a percent of GDP in the entire post-World War II period."
