729487662,4,"Second, the level of both short- and long-term interest rates comes down, and the yield curve becomes positive, with short rates dropping more than long rates. Corporations, with long rates at their recession lows, then move to convert their short-term obligations into long-term debts, thereby strengthening their liquidity. And investors are more willing to switch from short- to longterm securities."

Corporations met an enormous share of their financing needs by issuing commercial paper this year, increasing their debt through this medium by $45.6 billion in the first nine months of 1981 compared with $8.6 billion in 1980."

In leaving its official rates unchanged, the Fed continued to set aside the long-held doctrine that robust growth at a time of low unemployment leads almost inevitably to rising wages and prices.

729487841,6,"But there was no sign of such deterioration in figures for December released by the Labor Department Friday. Unemployment was essentially unchanged for the 18th consecutive month and employment showed surprising strength.

729487842,4,"Nonetheless, Administration economists continued to insist that weakness in autos and housing point to a general if mild recession.

729487843,6,Mr. Marshall‰ЫЄs forecast was interesting in two ways. It could be considered optimistic. And it is indicative of the dif- ficulty of using the overall national unemployment rate as the principal test of whether the economy is sick enough to Justify antirecession medicine.
729487844,3,"The reason the Labor Secretary‰ЫЄs projection seemed deliberately optimistic is that, as he knows, President Carter's economic'forecasters put the jobless rate at around 7.5 percent by Election Day. Furthermore, the unemployment rate is notoriously volatile. It could easily jump to 0.5 percent as early as March and go on climbing. As the Citibank economics staff has observed, ""Typically, unemployment rises rapidly in the early stages of a recession.‰Ыќ"
729487845,4,THIS fall‰ЫЄs election seems unlikely to alter the consensus that has emerged among the nation‰ЫЄs political leaders and their economic advisers that the necessary cure for inflation is a deliberately induced recession. What is not sufficiently appreciated is the effect that such a cure has on the American economy‰ЫЄs long-run growth rate ‰ЫУ not to mention the people who immediately lose their jobs.
729487846,3,"President Carter already stands apart from other recent Democratic chief executives in his open espousal of the recession cure. He has just finished applying this cure to the economy and, while the basic inflation rate has yet to fall, he is quick to point to his policy of restraining growth in the economy whenever one of the price indexes rises by less than in the previous month."
729487847,,"The President has now promised that, if re-elected, he will move to strengthen his wage-price stabilization program and, indeed, has even won some business and labor support for that effort. But when this and other measures fail to lower the inflation rate, Mr. Carter can be expected to bow to advice that he apply further restraint on the economy."
729487848,2,"Ronald Reagan might at first appear to offer an alternative set of policies. Certainly his proposal that Federal taxes be reduced by 30 percent over three years while expenditures are cut back by only 10 percent stands in sharp contrast to President Carter‰ЫЄs insistence on a balanced budget. Still, whatever might be the effect of these policies on the long-term growth rate ‰ЫУ and there is no reason to believe that the effect would not be a positive one ‰ЫУ they hardly speak to the inflation issue."
729487849,7,"In fact, when one passes from Mr. Reagan‰ЫЄs campaign statements to his list of economic advisers, it becomes clear what his anti-inflationary policy is likely to be. The advisers are many of the same group who persuaded previous Republican Presidents to apply the recession cure and thereby produce the economic downturns of 1953, 1958, 1960 and 1974. (The 1969 downturn was largely the respon- sibility of the preceding Democratic Administration.) If the anti-inflationary policy of a Reagan Administration is to differ from that of Mr. Carter, it will merely be that, in the words of the Reagan advisers, the recession cure will be applied ‰ЫПmore quickly‰Ыќ and allowed to continue longer."

But on April 30, the Fed granted broader underwriting powers to securities firm affiliates of the Bankers Trust Company, Citibank and the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Besides broadening their power to underwrite and trade revenue bonds, the ruling enhances their participation in the mortgage securities market and the commercial paper market."

729487903,,"Competition might not be keen immediately, however, since many issuers of revenue bonds have close relationships with securities firms with which they negotiate the terms of financings rather than asking for sealed bids."
729487904,6,First Boston offered the notes with a yield of 5.15 percent An official said that demand from wealthy individual investors was strong and added that the issue yielded slightly more than the 4.80 percent available recently on one-year notes issued by New York State.

729487925,3,"IF I he United Suites were any other country, these would surely be days of panic and austerity in Washington. With debts spiraling higher, a trade deficit exceeding $700 billion a year, and its currency plunging for years, the government would be forced to cut spending and jack up interest rates in a frantic bid to attract investment."
729487926,6,"But the United States is not any other country. For more than half a century, Americans have enjoyed a unique privilege in the global economy: The dollar has been the world‰ЫЄs dominant currency, the money used in most transactions and the repository for the national savings of many countries, including China, Japan and Saudi Arabia."
729487927,7,"Come what may ‰ЫУ a financial crisis here, a military misadventure there ‰ЫУ Americans could count on money sloshing up thick on their shores. Virtually limitless demand for American government bonds has supported the dollar‰ЫЄs value, and kept domestic interest rates down. Americans have been emboldened to spend in blissful disregard of their debts, secure that foreigners would always supply finance. And that devil-may-care spending has in turn fueled economic growth around the world."
729487928,3,This dynamic may be so deeply embedded in the workings of the global economy that it could endure for many years to come: The costs of weaning the United States from its credit habit would ripple far and wide.

At first glance, this should be getting easier. Endowments have tripled in the past decade thanks to the stock-market boom. Most professors earn around $56,000, while underfed graduate students do so much teaching that they are unionizing in droves. But if you think this means tuition cuts are coming, think again."
729488206,8,"Sticker prices at colleges and universities rose another 4 to 5 percent last year, capping nearly two decades in which they increased two and often three times faster than inflation. Price tags at top private schools are approaching $35,000 this fall. Even with 70 percent of students gening financial aid (including a doubling of annual loan volume in the last five years), the actual price families pay has still risen far faster than incomes, especially for middle- and low-income families. With both student debts and campus costs soaring, doesn‰ЫЄt something have to give?"
729488207,,"The answer depends on a paradox, because at today‰ЫЄs prices college is simultaneously a great deal ‰ЫУ and a huge rip-off."
729488208,,"Take the great deal first. The short answer to the question ‰ЫПWhy does college cost so much?‰Ыќ is that for most people it doesn‰ЫЄt, and where it does, families are lining up to pay even more. While the media obsess over Ivy League pricing, 80 percent of students attend four-year public universities where tuition, even after years of hikes, averages $3,200. Moreover, once aid is taken into account, fewer than 1 percent of students pay more than $20,000. Meanwhile, despite their high sticker prices, the elite private schools have as many as 10 applicants for every opening. The prestige of the degree, the chance to mix with the best and brightest and the lifelong benefits of an influential alumni network make these schools worth almost any sacrifice to parents."

In 1980, for example, the typical 25- to 34-year-old male graduate earned 19 percent more than his high-school counterpart; by 1995, the gap had widened to 52 percent.

This happened during the world monetary crisis that took shape in the 1960's. As soon as dollars started to move en masse into Germany, the press described it as a flood. The movement did in fact take on vast proportions because even modest speculators wanted to benefit from the situation. The press in turn wrote in terms of a veritable panic. Then all holders of capital got the news and reacted accordingly, and the dam burst under a pressure that had been generated solely by the media.

729488331,4,"Wage earners are acutely aware of the income tax bite in the paycheck. Few are aware, however, of the subtle effect inflation has on income tax rates. Thanks in part to inflation, our total income is higher and therefore is taxed at a higher rate, leaving our real spendable income relatively constant."
729488332,,"There is another hidden inflationary impact that has just as damaging effects ‰ЫУ on the capital gains tax. That tax, of course, is the Government‰ЫЄs share of any increased value received in selling a house, stock, jewelry, works of art ‰ЫУ anything that you sell for more than its purchase price. Capital gains, as they are called, are generally taxed at half of the usual tax rate to a maximum of 25 percent, although in large amounts the rate can rise to a high of 49.2 percent."
729488333,2,"The Carter Administration has proposed raising the tax on preference income, which includes capital gains. Businessmen and economists have presented evidence that an elimination of all taxes on capital gains would provide needed long-term benefits to the economy by increasing investment and creating jobs. Congress is studying the whole question."
729488334,,"But aside from these larger questions is the problem' of inflation. New economic studies have shown that inflation affects capital gains significantly more than it does income from salaries and wages. The results, in fact, suggest that the Government is collecting a tax on supposed profits that are ‰ЫУ in real terms ‰ЫУ losses.

729488363,4,But not all money market analysts share that view; many say the decline was not sufficient to brake the upward movement in interest rates of recent weeks. Interest rates tend to rise if investors fear that the Federal Reserve will curb the supply of money.

729488541,,"wimam Moranaus, a Yaie economist ana tormer member of President Carter‰ЫЄs Council of Economic Advisers, described inflation as an ‰ЫПinertial process,‰Ыќ like people standing up at a football game. When some people jump up to see better, other people can‰ЫЄt see unless they stand up, too. When everybody is up, people as a group can‰ЫЄt see as well as they did when they were all sitting; in fact, they probably see worse and are more uncomfortable. But the problem is how to get them all to sit down together."
729488542,5,"This can be done in a few ways. Pressing the analogy between inflation and the behavior of crowds, Professor Nordhaus said that you could make the game so boring that people would sit down again; in economics, this means inducing recession or depression by more restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. Or you could try to coax people into sitting down, the way a quarterback calls for a hush before he will call signals again; the economic equivalent is jawboning by the President or his aides. The third alternative ‰ЫУ equivalent to throwing people out of the football stadium ‰ЫУ is coercion by direct wage and price controls."
729488543,4,"Professor Nordhaus contended that there were three ‰ЫПgenuine‰Ыќ and three ‰ЫПfalse‰Ыќ strategies for controlling inflation. The three genuine strategies, he said, are creating economic slack, reducing produc- tion costs and moderating wage and price demands, and the three ‰ЫПfalse‰Ыќ strategies are fixing monetary rules, balancing the budget and limiting Government spending. There is no magic in rigid rules, he contended; they can work only by creating slack, cutting costs, or curbing wages and prices."
729488544,4,"He then offered a four-point plan for slowing inflation over the next five years, with detailed estimates of how much each measure would reduce the inflation rate. By creating slack, with unemployment averaging 7 percent from 1979 through 1984, the Government could chip off 1% to 3 percentage points from the rate, which otherwise would run from 9 to 10 percent a year for the next five years. But he estimated that each percentage-point cut in the inflation rate by reducing total demand would cost $200 billion in lost output."

729488551,5,"Bankers say the widening ‰ЫПspread,‰Ыќ visible in earnings reports filed in recent days, is needed so they can earn more on their good consumer and busi- ness loans to compensate for losses from rising defaults and delinquencies on such loans.

Whether a worker survives or is turned out, most will vow never again to pour their hearts and souls into any kind of a corporate endeavor.

729488796,7,Enthusiasm sparked by better-than-ex-pected results that I.B.M. had released after the market closed on Wednesday caused the Dow to surge nearly 80 points in early trading. Other technology issues rose sharply as well.
729488797,7,"But a warning from a Federal Reserve governor, Laurence H. Meyer, that the economy might be overheating raised fears that the Fed will increase interest rates when it meets again next month."
729488798,8,"‰ЫПThis morning was a continuation of the idea that corporate earnings were positive,‰Ыќ said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Kansas City, Kan. ‰ЫПBut in the afternoon it gravitated to the idea that positive earnings are the result of an economy that is too strong.‰Ыќ"

729488800,6,"The economic recovery turned 4 years old this month, making it one of the longest business expansions on :ecord. But economists who follow business cycles say the unusual length of the current growth phase does not by itself mean that a downturn is near."
729488801,6,"""It isn‰ЫЄt the age of a cycle per se that makes a difference,‰Ыќ says F. Thomas Juster, director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. ""It‰ЫЄs a question of going for a certain amount of time and finding that things get out of balance.‰Ыќ"
729488802,5,"To Mr. Juster and many other business cycle economists, signs of imbalances that might signal a recession simply have not appeared. If they are right, that could mean good news for the Carter Administration but bad news for those who believe a recession is necessary to bring down the level of inflation. However this outlook puts them at odds with many other economists who have already forecast the peaking of the current economic expansion and who say that a recession will hit sometime later this year."
729488803,,"‰ЫПThere‰ЫЄs been too much talk about a recession coming when that‰ЫЄs not clear at all,‰Ыќ says Solomon Fabricant, a staff member emeritus and director of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the long-standing arbiter of what is a recession and what is not."
729488804,3,"The business cycle, which underlies their analysis and predictions, serves as a yardstick for comparing current economic activity with previous periods. The cycle is nothing more than a four-part pattern: a period of economic growth, a peak in that growth, a period of slower growth or actual decline in the economy and a trough ‰ЫУ after which growth starts anew. Since the 1850‰ЫЄs, there have been 23 peacetime expansions with an average duration of 26 months."
729488805,6,"In the first in-depth survey of consumer sentiment in March, the Conference Board reported yesterday that its index of consumer confidence rose to 81 from 59.4 in February ‰ЫУ a record gain for a single month ‰ЫУ reflecting both relief that the Persian Gulf war had ended and optimism that the economy would improve by late summer."
729488806,,"But the Conference Board, a business organization, warned that the euphoria over the war‰ЫЄs end had apparently played such a big role in the upturn that it made the index a temporarily unreliable indicator of whether the recession might be ending. With the war effect gone, confidence could slide in April, said Fabian Linden, the survey‰ЫЄs director."
729488807,6,"""If there had not been a war, I would say, ‰ЫчYes, we are coming out of a recession gung ho,‰ЫЄ ‰Ыќ Mr. Linden said. ""Blit this jump in the index is too big to be explained by saying that people feel all that great about the economy and their jobs."""
729488808,6,"The survey of 5,000 households, completed in mid-March, asked how people felt about the economy, their job prospects and their incomes ‰ЫУ currently and over the next six months. The answers are tabulated into three indexes: one on future ex- pectations, one on the present situation and an overall index, now at 81, that combines the other two."

A second major survey of consumer sentiment, conducted by the University of Michigan‰ЫЄs Consumer Research Institute, has not been completed for March ‰ЫУ although a preliminary reading suggested that the Michigan results would be similar to the Conference Board's.

729488810,,"TOO many chief executives lack courage and imagination, writes Jim Jubak, a columnist for TheStreet.com. And rather than standing up against the short-term ‰ЫЄprofit demands of Wall Street, he says, they cut costs (meaning, jobs) and blame globalization for their woes."

When the economy is booming, the Fed is very good at slowing it down ‰ЫУ reducing inflation but also making it harder for people to buy homes, keep jobs and purchase cars. Then, a funny thing happens once the economy slows: The Fed gets reluctant to bring back prosperity."
729489026,4,"That reluctance is very much in evidence now. Until February, the economy was robust.

The pattern then was eerily similar to 1995, even to the month ‰ЫУ February ‰ЫУ when the policymakers decreed their last rate increase. And now the Fed, hewing to the practice of releasing transcripts with a five-year delay, has recently made public the 1989 transcripts. They offer a rare, fly-on-the-wall view of how Fed policymakers behave during a turning point in the economy."
729489028,4,"The details are different, then and now. The inflation rate was higher in 1989, for example, than it is today. Real estate was more of a drag on the economy, junk bonds were a problem, and wages seemed more likely to rise, contributing to inflation. But by all accounts, the dialogue and the dynamics of dealing with a slowing economy are strikingly similar. And seven of the 1989 policymakers are still there, starting with Alan Greenspan, the chairman."

Instead, just two months later on June 5, Mr. Greenspan ordered the first cut in rates. It was just a quarter-point decline, and he and his colleagues kept lowering rates bit by bit for the next three yeats.

729489036,6,"‰ЫПThe recovery in Europe has been stronger than expected,‰Ыќ said David Kingston, chief econoqjist for PA Management Consultants and a specialist in business strategy for the London-based firm."
729489037,,"The main reason, according to Mr. Kingston and many of his peers, is the strength of the dollar, which has spurred European exports to the United States. But modest increases in domestic consumer demand and more industrial investment than some analysts predicted are also factors."
729489038,,"‰ЫПThere‰ЫЄs been a sharp increase in manufacturing investment,‰Ыќ Mr. Kingston said. ‰ЫПIn some areas, such as advanced engineering materials like plastics, it is moving quite rapidly."""
729489039,,"A few analysts see an even brighter picture. Economists at Drexel Bum-ham Lambert Inc. argue that it is a mistake to attribute Europe‰ЫЄs progress to higher exports. They note that high exports are a result of ex-change-rate imbalances related to high interest rates in the United States, and that the rates have also had a depressing effect on Europe by luring some investment funds across the Atlantic."
729489040,,"The President‰ЫЄs Council of Economic Advisers has held out an attractive prospect. They see the United States moving from the present state of inflation and relative stagnation in real output to a sharply improved position in the years 1973-75. Then, they forecast, we will enjoy a growth rate of 4.3	per cent; unemployment will be held at 3.8 per cent; and annual price increases will be about 2 per cent."
729489041,6,It is true that production may now gradually expand; but I am aware of no serious analyst who believes the present prospects for employment and prices are consistent with these goals. I doubt that they can be achieved without wage-price guidelines in the early 1970‰ЫЄs any more than they were in the late 1950‰ЫЄs.
729489042,,"The technical issues surrounding wage-price guidelines are complex. But both analysis and experience, here arid abroad, show three things: ‰ЫўWage-price guidelines are no substitute for good fiscal and monetary policy, and to work well they also require purposeful manpower programs and a liberal trade policy."
729489043,,‰ЫўThey can make a significant contribution to reconciling a high rate of growth with relative price stability; they cannot hold prices steady if the forces of demand press too hard; but they can permit a higher rate of growth with less price increase.
729489044,5,"guidelines,, a 2 per cent price increase was associated with 5 per cent unemployment; in 1961-65, with wage-price guidelines, a 2 per . cent increase was associated with less than 4 per cent unemployment. That 1 per cent differential in unemployment means 3 per cent less increase in GNP,. or about $30 billion in wasted national resources; and it cuts public revenues by about $10 billion. Given the built-in claims on public revenues, an extra $10 billion is extremely important. The numbers, of course, can be debated; but we are evidently dealing with a critically important margin, for. public policy."

729489176,6,"But there was also a strong hint in yesterday‰ЫЄs report that the jobs boom may be moderating. While employers actually added 841,000 workers to their payrolls in May, the increase was rather paltry given it is usually the peak time of year for seasonal hiring.

729489195,3,President Nixon and Secretary of the Treasury Con-nally have now presented their design of the apparatus to administer Phase Two of the economic stabilization program. They have set as their goal slowing inflation to an annual rate of 2 to 3 per cent by the end of 1972.	But they have fudged the crucial question of what principles and standards will be required to reach that objective.
729489196,6,"Instead, they have thrown the problem of determining guidelines to the tripartite Pay Board that George Meany insisted upon, to a Price Commission consisting only of public members, and to a panoply of auxiliary panels. The Administration has retained some vague general responsibility over these new bodies‰ЫУenough to put in doubt Mr. Meany‰ЫЄs acceptance of membership in the Pay Board designed to his order."
729489197,,"Secretary Connally went to great lengths to downplay the degree to which the Government would interfere in the new stabilization policy. He insisted that he could scarcely conceive of circumstances in which the Cost of Living Council would ""lock horns‰Ыќ with the Price Commission or the Pay Board‰ЫУthis because he was sure that all the members to be appointed by the President would be as dedicated as he to the fight against inflation."
729489198,,"Far from specifying principles and standards in its own right, the Administration seems bent on encouraging the citizen boards to keep vague whatever standards they come up with. The commissions might in some cases grant very large increases, Mr. Connally said, but then they would have to grant smaller ones to average down. It would not be possible from particular decisions, he declared, to determine whether the program is ""succeeding or failing."""
729489199,3,"As part of this course, the Administration has ducked the most fundamental problem facing stabilization policy: What to do about existing wage contracts that call -for huge wage increases in their second and third years or that contain open-ended cost-of-living escalator clauses. This is a problem that was almost nonexistent in World War II or the Korean war when one-year contracts were the rule. If the President limply let these contracts stand, it would make much more difficult the task of moderating the rate of inflationary settlements in new wage agreements. But if he tried to interfere with the integrity of existing contracts, he might face a revolt from organized labor in the courts and on the picket line."

This time around, private credit demand and the economy have already cooled off on their own."
729489244,7,"‰ЫПIf anything, the Fed may try to get things moving again by loosening up on the money supply,‰Ыќ Mr. Brunie said.

With inflation rampant, homes suddenly became a ‰ЫПtangible‰Ыќ that could be purchased essentially lor their investment value. House-buying was promoted as a hedge against inflation, and in many markets people bought for speculation above all."
729489251,,"Now, with inflation curbed, mortgage rates seemingly unable to break below a level of about 13 percent and such formerly overheated markets as Houston, Denver and southeastern Florida decidedly cooled, the speculative boom has subsided. ‰ЫПThe bloom is off the rose,‰Ыќ said Arthur Wright, a housing economist at the Texas Real Estate Research Center in College Station, Tex."
729489252,,"But judging from comments by Mr. Wright and other housing economists, real-estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other specialists from coast to coast, the bloom has merely mellowed, and they are far from displeased about it. Traditional values in home-buying have reasserted themselves, they say, and the expectation of short-term appreciation is not as significant as it was."
729489253,6,"But the tax benefits and leveraging characteristics of real-estate investment still tempt the investment-oriented buyer. Few other investments enable the buyer to borrow at least 75 percent of the purchase price, thereby opening the door to leveraged gains upon resale if the property appreciates in value. In those markets that are not suffering the aftereffects of an overheated market ‰ЫУ among them New England and Long Island ‰ЫУ investment-oriented buying appears to be fairly strong."
729489254,,"Moreover, the rise of for-sale primary housing in the condominium or homeowner-association form has created a promising avenue for investment ownership because the problem of maintaining the unit is minimized.

729489446,4,"The Defense Department, the President said, is ‰ЫПthe only department in our entire program that will actually be increased over the present budgeted figure.‰Ыќ His increases, combined with those proposed by former President Carter, mean that defense spending will rise $28.6 billion from 1981 to 1982.

As it grows, interstate banking will exacerbate the already catastrophic effects of interest-rate deregulation, assuring that interest rates remain at historic highs. Yet, most economists and Washington officials continue to blame Federal deficits for high interest rates, not recognizing that deregulation of interest rates ‰ЫУ and the resultant competition among banks for depositors ‰ЫУ is the real culprit."
729489481,6,"Hardly anyone seems to understand how competition actually works. The standard economic view is that unrestricted competition provides lower prices, higher quality and better services for consumers. The greater the number of sellers competing for the favor of the individual buyer, it is believed, the more that buyer will benefit."
729489482,,"But the presumed advantages of unrestricted competition can be realized only if the resources needed by sellers are essentially limitless. Those who deregulated trucking and airlines, for example, correctly assumed that new firms could easily assemble the equipment and personnel they needed to enter the businesses. The deregulators accurately predicted that, as competition multiplied, at least some consumers would find real bargains among the many new choices available to them. This pattern holds true for shoes, refrigerators, computers and many other industries as well; banking is a major exception."
729489483,,"For bankers, the basic resource is money itself, and the supply of money is by no means limitless. It is regulated by central banks, in our case by the Federal Reserve Board. Some critics believe that the Fed is too restrictive, others argue that it is not restrictive enough, and some accuse it of inconsistency. Either way, it still regulates the money supply. When the supply of a basic resource is limited, unrestricted competition in that industry works in reverse; prices increase and may indeed skyrocket. This is easily demonstrated."

729489540,3,"The job market took a serious and unexpected turn for the worse last month, raising the risk of a recession and putting added pressure on the Federal Reserve to move more aggressively to keep the ailing housing industry from infecting the rest of the economy."
729489541,3,"The Labor Department reported yesterday that 4,000 jobs were lost from July to August, and the deepest cuts were in industries that are connected to the housing market, like construction and manufacturing. It was the first employment decline since 2003, when the job market was still struggling to emerge from the slump after the 2001 recession."
729489542,3,"The jobs report all but guarantees that the Fed will cut its benchmark short-term interest rate when its policy-making committee meets on Sept. 18. A quarter-point reduction, to 5 percent, remains the most likely move, although a half-point cut now cannot be ruled out, economists said."
729489543,3,"The unexpected weakness in employment changed the terms of the debate over the health of the economy. Before the report was released, most economists were predicting that the economy had added about 100,000 jobs in August and that growth had slowed but continued."
729489544,3,"But now, the odds of a recession in the next year have risen, to 25 to 50 percent, economists interviewed yesterday said.

729489545,6,"Steel stocks repeatedly have disappointed investors in recent years. Whether the laggard steels will find favor remains, of course, to be seen. But some analysts are taking a kindlier look at the group and projecting profit improvement over the next 12 to 15 months in gear with the economic recovery. One man who has become more positive about steels is Robert A. Hageman, senior metals and mining analyst for the Argus Research Corporation which provides economic and research services for the securities industry. He expressed his views last week in an interview with Vartanig G. Vartan of The New York Times. Portions of their conversation follow:"
729489546,4,"Q. Several leading industrial averages, as of the end of last week, showed gains of approximately 7 per cent in 1972. How have the steels been doing in the stock market? | A. As of Nov. 1, an index of the eight major steel issues is down 3 per cent from the end of 1971. These stocks are selling now at a price-earnings ratio of about 8 V2 times their 1972 earnings and at 7 times their estimated profits for next year. It‰ЫЄs important to note that this is far below the earnings multiples that prevailed for steels since the early nineteen-sixties. If a multiple of 9 times earnings is put on this index, one can see a 30 per cent gain in prices on the basis of estimated 1973 earnings."
729489547,4,"Q. Obviously, if steel stocks go up, some will do better than others. But, for clarification, what are the eight biggest producers."
729489548,,"Q. We‰ЫЄll get to those a bit later. But, in brief, what‰ЫЄs Happened to brighten the steel picture, Mr. Hageman?"
729489549,7,"A. The upswing in steel profits will derive from a number of factors, the most important of which is that steel consumption will be increasing at an above-average rate. Domestic steel consumption, by our estimate, will rise between 5 per cent and 6 per cent, both this year and next, compared with a compound annual growth rate of 3.4 per cent in the past decade. Another constructive factor is the new ceilings on imports, which means that the bulk of the consumption increase should accrue to domestic producers. This means that for the first time in the past decade the steel industry‰ЫУin 1972 and 1973‰ЫУwill be displaying two consecutive years of dynamically increased profits."
729489550,4,"Early in his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan declared that the risk of too much inflation was so considerable that he would ‰ЫПerr more on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus.‰Ыќ"
729489551,,"And he meant it. At his very first meeting, in August 1987, Mr. Greenspan established his inflation-fighting credentials by pushing up shortterm interest rates in response to only a modest rise in consumer prices, a move that contributed to the stock market crash just two months later."
729489552,,"Ben S. Bernanke, who is expected to take over at the Fed in February, will almost certainly echo Mr. Greenspan‰ЫЄs step, raising rates at his first meeting next year, in part to demonstrate his commitment, too, to keeping inflation under control. But for all the similarities of their actions upon taking office, Mr. Bernanke faces‰ЫЄ a fundamentally different set of circumstances than those ‰ЫПInflation is clearly not right around the corner like it used to be,‰Ыќ said Edward M. Gramlich, until recently a Fed governor and now interim provost at the University of Michigan. ‰ЫПThe relationships are different, and Mr. Bernanke is going to have to figure them out.‰Ыќ"
729489553,,"Perhaps the biggest differences are the rise of global production, as well as much easier access to capital, particularly from abroad. Adding to the change is labor‰ЫЄs weaker' bargaining power. These factors have combined to greatly diminish the force of old-style inflation in which demand outran supply, pushing prices ever higher, and wages,"
729489554,3,"Ben S. Bernanke, newly nominated to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, confronts a different situation from the one Alan Greenspan faced when he became chairman in 1987. The biggest difference is that core inflation ‰ЫУ consumer prices excluding food and energy ‰ЫУ is under control and seems less of a long-term threat."
729489555,4,The annual growth rate of worker productivity has varied widely over the last 15 years and can be tricky to measure. The annual figures for 1998 through 2000 were recently revised downward.
729489556,7,"JACKSON HOLE. Wyo., Sept. 2 ‰ЫУ Rising prosperity still bathed the nation a year ago when Alan Greenspan opened the annual symposium of Federal Reserve policy makers in this mountain resort with a confident boast that the strong gains in worker productivity that seemed to underlie the robust expansion of the 1990‰ЫЄs would continue."
729489557,3,"That contention appears to haunt him today. The nation‰ЫЄs boom has collapsed despite the faith of Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that the ever-greater efficiencies of the information age would keep on raising profits, incomes and employment at a healthy pace. Instead, the nation is barely skirting a recession, stock prices have fallen, the budget surplus is shrinking and the new economy is losing its charm."
729489558,3,"Adding injury to insult, the government just last month took the accelerating productivity figures that Mr. Greenspan cited so proudly a year ago and revised them downward. Instead of growing at an annual rate of 3.4	percent in 1999 and 2000, productivity ‰ЫУ the amount that a worker produces in a hour ‰ЫУ grew at a significantly slower rate of 2.6 percent a year during the best years of the economic boom."

729489561,3,"Two years ago, the Richland Equity Resources Corporation, a mortgage brokerage in Manhattan, sent a mailing to 600 clients and prospects saying that with interest rates near a 34-year low, it was an ideal time to refinance.

729489600,4,Small investors continue to move away from stocks and into mutual funds. Will this cause more volatility?
729489601,,"JRS the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through to record highs last month, Stephen A. Swets, a 38-year-old manager with a Chicago housing firm, switched some of his savings out of a Fidelity Investments bond fund and into one of the firm‰ЫЄs stock mutual funds. Mr. Swets said he made the switch because he is ‰ЫПoptimistic‰Ыќ about the current bullish stock market's long-term prospects, but he cautioned, ""This is not the time to be fully invested in stocks."""
729489602,4,"Indeed, many individuals share his view. The Dow and other measures of the bull market set records in recent weeks largely without the help of the individual investor. Daring souls like Mr. Swets are venturing back into stocks, but stock market experts now are questioning whether individual investors will ever return to the market in large numbers. ‰ЫПIt certainly isn't higher stock prices that will encourage the individual to come back in,"" said Steven G. Einhorn, chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ‰ЫПThe best we can hope for is that they slow their liquidations down."""
729489603,5,"In the view of many market analysts, what is happening is nothing less than a redistribution of the individual investors‰ЫЄ assets away from stocks and into a variety of other investments, a trend that began 20 years ago but has accelerated since the October 1987 stock market crash and shows few signs of ceasing. While many brokers are optimistically predicting the inevitable return of the individual investor to the current bull market, some analysts disagree. They suggest that there will be no new influx because the individual investor is already in the market through mutual funds, pension plans, employee stock ownership and savings plans."
729489604,5,"If individual investors are not coming back to the stock market ‰ЫУ or if they do, but only to stick a toe into an equity mutual fund, as Mr. Swets did ‰ЫУ the portents for the stock markets and the nation‰ЫЄs brokerage firms are immensely significant.

This could lead to more volatility in the markets."

The	/ doleful news Thursday from L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C-‰ЫЄs chairman, was that the fund to insure bank deposits needed authority to borrow another $70 billion. Lawmakers, fresh from providing $30 billion more to salvage the savings and loans, fear the worst As Charles A.

Maybe so. But the F.D.I.C.‰ЫЄs financing now seems as tottery as all the grandiose construction projects, leveraged buyouts and third-world investments that so many imperiled banks have financed."
729489616,3,"To judge from last week‰ЫЄs inflation report, this recession has none of the pleasure, all of the pain. Consumer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in February, but seven-tenths of 1 percent excluding the volatile costs of food and energy. Slower business usually means slower inflation as well. But prices have risen just as much in the six months since August, about when the recession began, as in the six months before. Some economists say that slack commodity and labor costs and unused capacity at factories will keep inflation in check. As Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc., asked, ‰ЫПBecause you had a snowstorm in New York a couple weeks ago, does that mean winter is going to be here with us for two or three months?‰Ыќ But after the inflation report blew stock and bond prices down, investors started shivering."

The region‰ЫЄs exploding population and pell-mell industrialization have left it with air that stings the eyes, bums the throat and leaves many children with permanently impaired breathing. Restricting motorists to alternate driving days has made little apparent difference. Robert A Pastor, director of the Latin American program at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said that the arrest of the Pemexoil company's powerful union boss in a 1989 shoot-out helped make last week‰ЫЄs action possible."
729489620,7,"At first glance, Alan Greenspan appeared lo offer Congress a relatively painless way to slash $150 billion from the Federal deficit over the next five years. But when it comes to saving money in Washington, nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems."
729489621,6,"Last month, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers that Inflation might be overstated by as much as 1.5 percentage points In official Government figures.

""Ultimately, it will be Congress that will change the law, after listening to a variety of experts."" cans on Capitol Hill. He appeared to offer a way out of one of their biggest quandaries: how to cut spending on Federal entitlement programs without a specific vote that would clearly tamper with politically sacrosanct Social Security benefits. It would also allow Congress to increase tax revenues at a faster rate without requiring a political death wish: a vote to increase income taxes."
729489625,7,"SN the 1990‰ЫЄs, the performance of the American stock market has been nothing short of amazing, particularly in the last three years. Over that stretch, investors in the Standard & Poor‰ЫЄs 500-stock index have seen their money more than double. That had never happened before in so short a period."
729489626,,"Much of that performance has come from demographics, as the baby boom reaches the age when, it seems wise to invest for retirement and surveys an investment scene characterized by interest rates far lower than when the boomers were young and borrowing to buy homes."
729489627,6,"But the stock market‰ЫЄs outstanding performance reflects more than demographic levitation. It has had an important fundamental support: Corporate earnings have also risen, with a consistency and a magnitude not seen in nearly half a century."
729489628,5,"To be sure, stock prices have also risen rapidly, leading some to question whether investors are overpaying when they buy stocks. And companies do not necessarily have to have earnings to be stock-market stars. The best performer of last year, excluding stocks that began the year at less than $5, showed a gain of more than 500 percent. It was an Internet company that has yet to show an annual profit. And its name aptly summed up the attitude among stock market investors: Yahoo. (Ranking second was another money-losing Internet company with an appropriate name for this market: Mindspring Enterprises.)"
729489629,7,"Still, for most companies profits do count. And the very persistence of rising profits has helped to convince investors that it does not matter if you pay a bit much for a stock based on current conditions: better days and higher profits that are coming will more than offset that."

729489651,3,It is puzzling that the obvious and only means of coping quickly and effectively with the present inflation appears to have been completely overlooked in the debate: write up the dollar in relation to other currencies.
729489652,4,"It is well-known that the strong increase in the rate of inflation has been imposed upon the United States from abroad through increased commodity prices, cereals and fuel prices in particular, and that the only way to shelter an economy against world inflation is to revalue its currency appropriately. Domestic prices of export and import goods would then remain constant in face of increasing foreign prices."
729489653,4,"The policy should be to take a substantial initial increase in the dollar value to compensate for the increase in fuel and cereals prices that took place last year, accompanied with a declaration of the Government‰ЫЄs intention to continue revaluing, should world inflation continue.

Would not that indicate that revaluation is an unrealistic idea? The answer is simple: First, this country is an oil importer.

Mitt did not even get a chance to ask Huckabee why, in a new Times Magazine interview, he coyly dropped the question of whether Mormons' believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers."

729489779,,"While the record high yield on the Mountain States debentures was ample testimony to the lack of investors in the long-bond market, analysts also pointed to the selling price of the issue, which was 3% points below par.

729490052,3,"This renewed labor militancy Is sure to complicate the task of restoring price stability to the economy. Wage increases that outrun gains in productivity will exert further leverage On prices. In addition, generous wage settlements help to sustain the expectations that feed inflation. On the other hand the unions‰ЫЄ claims have a strong ring of equity in making their members whole for past economic losses. There is no obvious or easy way out of this dilemma."
729490053,3,"The origins of this situation are readily apparent For nearly three years, trade union behavior was orchestrated by cues from the Government. However, while unions generally respected the spirit if not the letter, of the old Pay Board standard limiting annual wage gains to 5.5 per cent prices soared at a double-digit rate by the beginning of 1974. As a result, the purchasing power of the average worker‰ЫЄs weekly take-home pay dipped by 4.6 per cent in the last 12 months."
729490054,,"With the expiratioh of controls, union leaders have moved to rectify this imbalance. The East Coast longshoremen‰ЫЄs union recently negotiated a 31 per cent wage increase over a three-year period. In San Francisco, the plumbers won an 18 per cent pay hike for one year, raising the hourly rate to $15.20‰ЫУa figure associated more with airline pilots than with leaky faucets. Even In the men‰ЫЄs clothing industry, where the union traditionally has been wary of wage competition from non-union firms, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers won an estimated 30 per cent pay Increase for three years. Over-all, a 10 per cent wage gain has become an accepted target for union negotiators."
729490055,6,"Unions also have pressed for protection against future erosion of real earnings. Like many businessmen, labor leaders were not sure whether the upsurge of prices that began in early 1973 was a passing indisposition or the beginning of a prolonged ailment. As it became apparent that the economy was In for an extended siege of inflation, these expectations have been reflected in union demands at the bargaining table."
729490056,,"Productivity is the fulcrum on which a great many other economic variables rest, and it is therefore an active topic of discussion‰ЫУbut most of that discussion is loose, oversimplified, distorted and sometimes meaningless. At the very 'least, we should be dear cm what we are talking about when the topic is as crucial to our welfare as this one is."
729490057,,This is particularly important because of widespread concern that productivity in the United States has been advancing at a much slower rate over the past JO years than during the first 20 years after World War II.
729490058,3,"For example, growth in output per hour of work in the private business sector of our economy averaged 3.3 percent a year from 1948 to 1966. but only 2.1 percent a year from 1966 to the business cycle peak in 1973 (productivity always slows down during recessions). If we indude nonprofit organizations and Government as well as private employers, the deterioration appears to be even more dramatic."

The economic news was universally bad: producer prices at the wholesale level soared a full percent in March, brineine the first quarter increase in the index to 14.1 percent on an annual basis, the highest level since 1974.

729490247,8,"Signed by Allan Sproul, president, the report points out that 1950 presented a paradoxical record of economic change.

729490256,6,"erven tnougn tne local economy is expanding and tax revenues are growing. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to announce a relatively austere budget tomorrow that calls for New York City to increase most spending at less than the inflation rate, administration officials said yesterday. Under the Mayor‰ЫЄs proposal, the city would squirrel away much of its current budget surplus to help close anticipated shortfalls in the next two years, the officials said."
729490257,6,"The Mayor is expected to announce that the city will finish the 1998 fiscal year with,a surplus of $1.2 billion, thanks in large part to a surging Wall Street. It will be the second year in a row of good fortune for the city, which was pummeled by the recession in the early 1990‰ЫЄs. The city ended its last fiscal year with $1.4 billion more than it expected."
729490258,7,"But in contrast to the election-year budget that he presented at this time last year, which called for sharply increased spending on education, children‰ЫЄs services and other programs, the Mayor is returning to the conservative fiscal stance that he took early in his first term, when he pushed through some of the largest spending cuts since the city‰ЫЄs fiscal crisis of the 1970‰ЫЄs.	,"
729490259,6,"The new budget calls for spending on most programs to increase by roughly six-tenths of 1 percent, well under the annual local inflation rate of about 2 to 2.5 percent, administration officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Mayor also plans to call for cuts in some programs, j ‰ЫПThe message of this budget is that we are putting the city on a sound financial course,‰Ыќ said a senior administration offij-cial. The overall size of the budget, including Federal and state grants, is expected to be $34 billion to $35 billion.	!"
729490260,6,"While the Mayor is proposing that the city reserve most of the surplus to deal with shortfalls in the next two years, some independent fiscal experts say he should use the money for more long-term deficit reduction. In other words, he could allocate the surplus in ways that would spread out the deficit reduction over several years, instead of just the next two. He could do that, for example, by retiring some of the city‰ЫЄs growing longterm debt, which would reduce city‰ЫЄs payments of principal and interest."

729490271,6,"WASHINGTON, May 19 ‰ЫУ The economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter this year, slower than originally estimated, the Commerce Department reported today."
729490272,6,"The downward revision from an original estimate of 3.1 percent was a result of a sharper decline in inventories than had been assumed, however, and does not change the outlook for significantly stronger growth this quarter, economists said."
729490273,6,"Several measures of corporate profits released today left a mixed picture of business activity in the quarter. The Commerce Department‰ЫЄs preferred measure, profits from current production, jumped 12.4 percent from last year‰ЫЄs fourth quarter, after having slipped 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The better-known measure of after-tax profits declined 4.6 percent after falling 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter."
729490274,7,"Growth Increase Expected ""Although the estimated increase in first-quarter real G.N.P. has been lowered somewhat, the basic message of the revised data is positive,‰Ыќ said Robert G. Dederick, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. ""With output apparently already running well above the first-quarter average in April, the odds favor a sigifi-cant acceleration in the G.N.P. growth rate for the second quarter.‰Ыќ The predictions of stronger growth for this quarter are based on recent economic data for April, including a 2.1	percent surge in industrial production and a 1.6 percent rise in retail sales. Scheduled rises in auto production and the sharp increases in personal income and consumer spending in April that were reported Wednesday are also reinforcing the expectations of stronger growth."
729490275,6,"Except for the deeper decline in inventories, the picture of the first quarter is about the same as originally estimated. About two-thirds of the $9 billion inflation-adjusted rise in the gross national product came from a $6.8 billion gain in housing construction."
729490276,3,"To defend the dollar, it has repeatedly been suggested, the United States ought to raise domestic interest rates to at-tract international capital, thereby off-setting the current, record trade deficit."
729490277,7,"In fact, policies aimed at facilitating an outflow of capital, particularly to the developing and smaller industrialized countries, would contribute more to the dollar‰ЫЄs long-run defense!"
729490278,4,"Tighter money will indeed lead to a stronger dollar in the short run, but it will also choke off real growth and is likely to weaken the dollar in the longer run. Some economic forecasters already see the possibility of a credit crunch later this year, leading to a major recession in 1979, and the Federal Reserve‰ЫЄs defense of the dollar through high interest rates substantially increases the likelihood of a debilitating crunch."
729490279,1,"The dollar‰ЫЄs current weakness does not stem from an inability to attract international capital: indeed, the United States is probably attracting too much capital for its state of development. During 1977, on a net basis, the United States borrowed about $20 billion overseas. Though much of these borrowings were involuntary, reflecting the efforts . to bolster the dollar through exchange-market intervention, some capital was attracted to the United States by the security of investment here and the relatively high rate of return."
729490280,,"The truth is that to achieve a more efficient worldwide allocation of resources, mature economies such as the United States ought to be net capital exporters‰ЫУnot capital importers. With the worldwide distribution of capital, labor and resources, the productivity of capital is higher in a number of other countries, including many of the developing nations, than in the United States."
729490281,7,"Sharply rising exports in the first; quarter produced the most spectacular improvement in the nation‰ЫЄs trade deficit in any quarter since the dollar began its decline in 1985, the Commerce Department said yesterday."
729490282,4,"Edward E. Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities; ‰ЫПThis revision is almost certain to be upward, unless the strong exports are offset by such factors as weaker retail sales or a decline in inventory growth.‰Ыќ sonal variations not accounted for in the trade data released each month, and they also include some exports and imports not originally reported. But the quarterly report, parallelling the monthly figures, confirmed the downward trend evident in the January, February and March reports."
729490283,7,The quarterly figures support broad conjecture among economists that the gross national product in the first quarter may have grown at an annual rate of 2.8 percent or more instead of the 2.3 percent rate announced last month.
729490284,7,"As new figures come in, such as yesterday‰ЫЄs updated trade data, the Commerce Department revises its initial G.N.P. estimate for each quarter. The first revision of the 2.3 percent estimate for the first quarter will be announced today."

The moment is ripe for a counterintuitive, optimistic perspective that shows, despite appearances to the contrary, that the world is getting better and better every day, in every way. Gregg Easterbrook tries hard to satiate our inner optimist with ‰ЫПSonic Boom."""

In ""Sonic Boom,‰Ыќ his principal thesis is that the 2008 financial crisis is merely a modest hiccup in a larger trend of ""growth, change and transformation at unprecedented velocity.‰Ыќ Once the recession is over, he argues, rapid innovation and globalization will reassert themselves. Acknowledging the stresses renewed change will bring, Easterbrook nevertheless believes that the pluses vastly outweigh the minuses. A prolific writer for The Atlantic and The New Republic, Easterbrook knows how to capture a popular audience, as anyone familiar with his Tuesday Morning Quarterback column for ESPN.com is aware. But there are many problems with ‰ЫПSonic Boom,"" beginning with its title and central metaphor. Easterbrook argues that globalization is indeed like a sonic boom: ‰ЫПnoisy, superfast, covering huge amounts of territory.""

Rummaging around in Thomas Friedman‰ЫЄs discarded metaphor bin is never a good idea, a fact that seems to dawn on Easterbrook halfway through this book. Sonic booms make fewer appearances in the later pages. As for the rest of the arguments here, Easterbrook tends to contradict himself or make sweeping declarations that don't hold up to scrutiny. At one point, he writes that the Internet is largely responsible for ""much faster, more compelling and more accurate news.‰Ыќ Fine, except that just a paragraph earlier he characterizes the Internet as ‰ЫПa source of befuddlement rather than enlightenment.‰Ыќ Easterbrook makes both statements with equal conviction, leaving the reader himself a bit befuddled.

729490439,4,"But the discontent is more complex than the polls can convey. Across the country, the sense that the nation is on the edge of bad times colors daily life."
729490440,,"In the Midwest, farmers who have saved and worked hard for years remain uneasy that everything they have gained could slip away at any moment. In New Hampshire, the first primary state, workers are striking at paper mills and knitwear factories. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently seized five failed banks."
729490441,6,The recovery move was not as broad as the decline a day earlier but many leading issue's regained much of the ground they lost in the big sell off a day earlier.
729490442,6,The upswing was helped along by new signs of diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis in the Middle East and by some favorable economic developments on the home front.
729490443,6,The domestic developments included final Congressional approval of a bill to restore the investment tax credit and a Commerce Department report that new factory orders rose in April.
729490444,6,"Market analysts also said that the market was ready for a technical rebound after Wednesday‰ЫЄs slide, which, in the opinion of many, put prices into the ‰ЫПoversold‰Ыќ category."
729490445,6,"In a rare coincidence, the Dow-Jones industrial average rose by the exact amount it lost the day before, closing at S64.9S, up 12.42 points."
729490446,4,"DIZZYING swings have kept the stock market off balance in a period of political limbo between Washington administrations. Last week the Dow Jones industrials soared 40 points, to top 1,000,	in response to signs of peaking interest rates. But virtually the entire advance evaporated in the following two sessions after Joseph Granville, the market analyst, sent a flash message to his customers who pay extra for early warnings. He advised them to ‰ЫПsell everything.‰Ыќ"
729490447,6,Mr. Granville sent the flash a day after a letter had reached all his clients urging them to buy. His change of heart was almost as swift as the one he had at the market low last April when a letter urging all clients to sell arrived while preferred clients were getting a flash telling them to buy.
729490448,,The lesson seems to be that a market analyst can have inordinate impact at times of extreme markets. So what is an investor to do?
729490449,,"Robert Farrell, analyst of market timing for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, says securities buyers would be wise to limit margin purchases, take a long view of the market and ignore temporary selling sprees."
729490450,1,"Mr. Farrell is not one to look at the market merely from a short-term point of view. His weekly market commentary, written on Sunday night, is received the next morning by Merrill Lynch‰ЫЄs 400 worldwide offices. A poll taken annually by Institutional Investor magazine has rated Mr. Farrell at the top of his category in each of the last five years."
729490451,7,"CHANGES in the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates may be the best means of forecasting business-cycle turning points. When short rates are lower than long ‰ЫУ as they are now ‰ЫУ the economy tends to grow. But when long rates drop below short, recession looms."
729490452,1,"Over the last 25 years, movements in the ""term structure"" of interest rates, or yield curve, have correctly predicted all the major peaks and troughs in the United States business cycle, according to Prof. Campbell R. Harvey of Duke University‰ЫЄs Fuqua School of Business."
729490453,,"Unlike other indicators, the yield curve has put out no false signals. In the third quarter of 1968, the curve began an inversion, changing its slope from positive to negative, and correctly signaled the recession of 1969-70, which started five months after long rates dropped below short rates."
729490454,3,"The yield curve inverted two months before the 1973-75 recession began. In the fourth quarter of 1978 and in the fourth quarter of 1980, the yield curve inverted, recovered and inverted again, correctly predicting the double-dip recessions of 1980 and 1981-82, which some economists see as one recession."
729490455,3,"How about the latest recession, which may or may not be over? The Administration attributed the onset of the recession to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf crisis in August 1990. But the inversion of the yield curve in the second quarter of 1989 had predicted the downturn that began five months later ‰ЫУ the average lag between inversions and recessions."

729490471,3,"Last week, the United States Gold Commission issued a report based on more than eight months of study that formally rejected a return to the gold standard. Following are excerpts from the section on domestic monetary arrangements, and comments by commission members."
729490472,5,"WE considered a number of alternatives that would serve to reintroduce gold into our domestic monetary policy arrangements. The objective would be to improve monetary control through the discipline of gold for the purpose of reducing inflation. Linking changes in the growth rate of money or of some component of money, such as Federal Reserve notes, or of bank reserves, to the change in the gold stock is one approach which was considered for imposing the discipline of gold."
729490473,,"One way to reintroduce gold would be to require the Federal Reserve System to maintain a minimum ratio between the Government‰ЫЄs gold stock and the Federal Reserve monetary base (i.e., Federal Reserve notes plus bank reserves) or some monetary aggregate. A variant would fix upper and lower limits to the ratio, so that the System would be required to take expansionary actions when the ratio was at its lower limit. The gold cover requirement might be valued at the price of $42.22, or adjusted gradually, or allowed to fluctuate with market prices."
729490474,,"Along traditional gold-standard lines, the United States could define the dollar as a specified weight of gold (that is, fix the price of gold), set gold cover requirements for the Federal Reserve System, and allow the value of the gold stock to be determined by domestic and international gold flows. If the value of the gold stock rose through an inflow of gold, the Federal Reserve would be required to undertake actions to expand the money stock. If the value of the gold stock declined, it would be required to take contractionary actions."
729490475,,"Most members of the Commission believe that a return to the gold standard is not desirable. Even if that were not our view, for most of us there are two major problems in contemplating the feasibility of a return to a domestic gold standard. One is the absence of a sound guide on how to determine the fixed dollar price of gold at which resumption of a gold cover requirement could be introduced. The other one is the absence of a sound guide on the extent of feasible convertibility of domestic dollar obligations."

729490478,,"‰ЫПWe think the system devised by the Federal Reserve Board is inequitable for retailers,‰Ыќ said Verrick O. French, senior vice president of the National Retail Merchants Association. ‰ЫПWe will be penalized for doing half as well next Christmas as we did last Christmas.‰Ыќ ‰ЫПI don‰ЫЄt think any of this is equitable, frankly,‰Ыќ said Nancy H. Teeters, a Fed governor who is administering the consumer credit controls."
729490479,1,"The omissions, on the other hand, covered a broad variety of areas. For example, the Fed program excludes utilities but apparently includes fuel oil dealers who offer consumers the chance to spread their winter payments across the year."

729490481,1,"We know that unemployment declined from the March level of 5,198,000 to 5,120,000 in April, the lart reporting month, a reduction of 78,000. We also know other things about the April unemployment figure. We know that while it represented a numerical decline from the previous month, that decline was purely the result of seasonal factors. Adjusted to take account of these factors the April decline turns to an increase‰ЫУan increase from the 7 per cent of the civilian labor force that obtained in March to one of 7.5 per cent. In the period 1954-57, the average downturn in unemployment was roughly 0.4 per cent."
729490482,6,"In other words, on the basis of the experience of these four years, April, 1958, was out of line by 0.9 per cent. And 0.9 per cent of the civilian labor force of 68,000,000 comes to 7.5	per cent of the civilian labor force, April unemployment stood at a point 2.3 times its most recent (seasonally adjusted) low level of September, 1956, when the corresponding figure was 3.3 per cent."

In addition to larger reductions in manufacturing, there has been significant easing in some non-manufacturing lines in which employment held up in the earlier recessions. workers have declined despite further advances in wage rates. The average work week has been shortened, overtime work ;at premium rates has been eliminated or sharply curtailed, and the number of workers on part time has greatly increased. Moreover, the purchasing power of all incomes, including wages and salaries, has been further reduced by continued increases in consumer prices."
729490484,8,"3.	The sustained growth ; and major structural changes characteristic of the labor force in the past decade have been continuing. The importance of women as gainful workers has continued to grow; service and government activities have come to employ a larger proportion of all employes and industrial activities a smaller proportion; the ratio of salaried workers to wage workers in manufacturing industries has risen almost without interruption, and the number of workers on farms has declined further."

The unemployment rate exceeded 10 per cent in April in the construction, mining and manufacturing industries. It has risen from 5 to 11 per cent in manufacturing and from 5 to 13 per cent in mining since last year. One in six construction workers was unemployed in April, 1958. This was the highest unemployment rate for any major industry but the increase from a year earlier was less than that in many other industries. Unemployment rates among service and government workers have been relatively low."

729490487,7,"In the latest issue of its Monthly Review, published today, the Reserve Bank offers these reasons for this inference: 0 While the economic recovery in the second quarter was even stronger than had been generally expected, there was some slackening of the rate of advance in June and July, on top of usual seasonal influences."
729490488,3,"qin contrast to previous recessions, bank loans to business rose moderately during the recent downturn. This has prevented banks from restoring liquidity as they did in 1954-55 and 1957-58."
729490489,2,"The Reserve Bank said there was no question that the proposed $3,500,000,000 increase in the defense budget sought by President Kennedy to meet the Berlin crisis would be a strong expansionary influence."
729490490,4,"But, it added, it is difficult to say to what extent the increased spending will speed a return to full utilization of the economy‰ЫЄs resources or when it will begin to exert an upward pressure on prices."
729490491,,"It‰ЫЄs intimidating to review the journal of a man who can write a good novel in the time it takes a fallible human to turn out a passable book review. Intimidating or not, you don‰ЫЄt pass up the chance for a glimpse into a mind that has produced so much fiction in 40 years of high-pressure productivity."
729490492,,"Georges Simenon is more than prolific, His psychological intensity and compression of style mark him (Gide was one of the first to recognize this) as a leading writer of the century."
729490493,,"There is a deliberately inscrutable quality to Simenon‰ЫЄs novels (even to his Inspector Maigret mysteries, although I‰ЫЄve always found them slack and predictable, and Simenon himself says in this journal he writes them when he‰ЫЄs not up to what he calls a ‰ЫПnon-Maigret‰Ыќ)."
729490494,,"His novels consist of about 200 pages in which there is not a scrap of authorial philosophizing, not the least overt sign of trying to prove a point. People and events are simply there, quite humanly there. With his unique way of composing a book‰ЫУ a quick scene, a few lines of dialogue without the ""he says,‰Ыќ a brief memory, something seen or smelled, a one-paragraph flashback, no set-pieces‰ЫУthe parts come together like a dream seen by a clear-eyed sleeper, always fascinated by what people can do to themselves or each other, but never surprised. One senses the author by his near-total absence, by what might be called his Olympian sympathy."
729490495,,"So one turns to his journal with more than the usual curiosity about what a writer is really like, and from the outset Simenon seems in a mood to level. ‰Ыч‰ЫчIn 1960, 1961, and 1962,‰Ыќ he writes in a preface, ""for personal reasons, or for reasons I don‰ЫЄt know myself, I began feeling old, and I began keeping notebooks.

729490502,,"At 32, Mr. Di Stefano, married with three children, has not had steady work in years. His job picking the blood red oranges for which this region was famous disappeared when cheaper North African imports hit the market.

729490536,4,ADVOCATES of supply-side eco-ftl comics have argued that the tax ^^cuts in the 1981 tax legislation are a crucial component of the Administration's plan to restore economic vitality and reduce inflation.
729490537,,"In particular, they feel that tax cuts on investment income will encourage both savings and risk taking, thereby facilitating corporate investment, raising productivity and slowing inflation. I find, however, that although the tax cuts provide an incentive for greater savings, they generally serve to discourage risk taking."
729490538,4,"The tax cuts on investment income are the only element of the 1981 tax package that has received virtually unanimous support. Critics of the tax act have argued that the reduction of the tax rate on wages and salaries will probably encourage consumption and therefore be inflationary, while corporate tax cuts in the form of faster depreciation and expanded investment tax credits are ambiguous, since it is unclear which constituency (stockholders, bondholders, employees or customers) benefit from them."
729490539,,"When the tax rate on interest and dividend income and an capital gains is reduced, however, investors can expect a higher after-tax rate of return on their savings, and this factor, the supply-eiders argue, will lead them to invest more heavily in corporate securities, pulling up common stock and corporate bond prices and reducing companies‰ЫЄ costs of capital."

Faddish, adjustable-rate mortgage funds have also attracted yield seekers, but have been among the year‰ЫЄs worst performers."
729490549,4,"The standard advice to wary bond investors is to shorten maturities, because going from 20 or more years to 5 or 10 can usually preserve much of the yield with less chance of loss.

As of yesterday, the five-year yielded 4.6 percent, the 30-year 5.9 percent.

Mr. Marshall asked for an immediate appropriation of $597,000,000 to aid France, Italy and Austria until March 31, after which he estimated that $1,-500,000,000 would be required to carry the relief program until June 30, 1948, and $6,000,000,000 additional for the full year ending on June 30, 1949."

The proposals would mean a continuation of ‰ЫПan intolerable burden on the American people,‰Ыќ he said. Such diverse views betoken a lively session. It is a question whether the aid, no matter how small or large, will infuence the political thinking of the people we assist.

The growth of such loans in these banks, it was noted, has been paralleled by that in member banks in the country as a whole."
729490899,6,"At the end of 1949, it was pointed out, the largest single component of consumer installment loans was $235,000,000 of retail installment paper other than for automobiles. And this, the bank observed, contrasts with the situation in the remainder of the country, where the largest segment of member banks' installment loans consists of automobile paper. Personal installment cash loans, at $219,000,000, were the next largest component in this district, while repair and modernization loans amounted to $186,000,000, and automobile loans had the smallest total, $162,000,000."

First, the post-Labor Day session failed to show any follow-through of the previous week‰ЫЄs selling. But, as the week progressed, prices weakened in heavier trading, with many leading issues touching new lows for the year or longer. Railroad, motor and steel issues wore particularly vulnerable to the selling."
729490907,3,"Those who expected to see fireworks in the stock market the day after Labor Day were disappointed. In the slowest trading since Sept. 5, 1949‰ЫУwhich incidentally, was also a Tuesday after Labor Day-‰ЫУthe, volume of trading fell to 749,000 shares. Prices were fractions higher at the close after the narrowest1 dealings in two months."
729490908,,"Perhaps the fact that September in by-gone years has been a month in which many economic pitfalls have occurred accounted for the hesitancy of the trading fraternity in acting too quickly after the holiday in starting the week‰ЫЄs campaign. Nevertheless, the dullness after the break-through in the previous week to new lows proved puzzling to many and raised the question whether in the light of the extended decline in prices this year the readjustment in business after the Korean truce had not been more than discounted."
729490909,2,"But the lull in trading in the first two sessions of the week soon ended with a decision to continue the downward trend in prices. Late on Thursday, a new selling wave set in that dislodged prices from fractions to two points. Losses in some of the leading railroad,1 motor and oil issues ranged even higher. The New Tokk times‰ЫЄ average of twenty-five rails fell to a new low since May 1, 1952 and went even lower on Friday, when the liquidation was continued in heavier trading.

At this juncture there are enough cross-currents of opinion to bring a steadying effect to prices.

729490911,4,"If you are trying to finance a new automobile with a five-year loan, you may find it more difficult to get one these days.

The Fed hoped to calm debate over its next move and prepare markets for the likelihood that it would pour money into the economy by resuming purchases of government, and possibly private, debt."
729490938,4,"The new action would be aimed at lowering long-term interest rates and spurring growth, but it would also have effects far beyond American shores. It could contribute to the weakening of the dollar and complicate a festering currency dispute that threatens to disrupt global trade relations."
729490939,3,"For Americans, additional Fed activity is likely to mean that already low 30-year mortgage rates would fall even further. The moves would not help many savers, however, as yields on certificates of deposit and savings bonds would probably fall as well. But the Fed hopes that making credit even cheaper will encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and that could eventually bring relief to jobless workers."

729490941,6,"One of the most encouraging developments in the economy this year has been the sharp decline in interest rates over the last five months. Although the drop coincided with a weakening in the economy, lower rates have put new life into the stock market, where prices have rebounded from the summer lows, while also holding out hope that the economy will not slide into a full-fledged recession."
729490942,3,"The catalyst for lower Treasury bond yields ‰ЫУ which yesterday fell to the lowest level of the year amid conjecture that leading economic indicators will be very weak when they are announced today ‰ЫУ was a slowdown in economic growth from the potentially inflationary 8^ percent growth rate of the first half. More recently, the decline has spread to short-term interest rates as the Federal Reserve responded to the weakening of the economy with an easier monetary policy."
729490943,6,"‰Ыч'Rates have further to go in the downward direction,‰Ыќ said Peter Treadway, chief economist at Cralin & Company, a securities firm. High rates earlier in the year contributed to the slowdown in economic activity, he said, adding that the drop in rates was likely to continue until economic activity rebounded and the demand for credit increased."
729490944,6,"The decline in rates is good news for the economy,‰Ыќ said Francis H. Schott, chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society. While Mr. Schott still expects rates to rise in 1985, he said ‰ЫПthe increases will start from a lower base and the timing of the rise has been pushed out to the second half of next year rather than the first half.‰Ыќ"
729490945,4,"In the Treasury bond market, where yields have been falling since late May as investors and speculators responded to signs of the weakening economy and low inflation, the yield on bellwether 30-year issues has dropped to 11.57	percent, from 14 percent. Treasury bill rates were slower to fall, but since the Federal Reserve flashed the green light In September of an easier monetary policy, the rate on three-month bills has fallen to about 9.20 percent, from 10.63 percent on Sept. 4."
729490946,6,"THE BOND MARKET, once the domain of Institutions and the very rich, has gone pleblan in recent years and has been drawing far more money from household investors than the stock market. In the last eight years, individuals invested $196 billion in all kinds of Treasury securities and $55 billion in the tax-exempt market, while their sales of common stocks exceeded purchases by $109 billion. This year, public demand for tax-exempt bonds Issued by state and local governments has been especially heavy. These bonds are exempt from Federal income tax, and in some cases, state income tax."
729490947,3,"In essence, the public has been attracted to the bond market by the availability of 10 percent and higher interest rates that seem high compared with the 5 percent rate of inflation over the last year and forecast for next year."
729490948,5,"Furthermore, bond yields have recently been higher than the yield on money market funds and considerably higher than the dividend yield on common stocks. In 1982, money began flowing more readily to the long-term bond market once short-term interest rates declined to levels that were less than the yields on long-term bonds. That is in contrast with 1981 and early 1982, when yields on shortterm securities were higher than on long-term bonds ‰ЫУ a condition which detered investment in long-term bonds and drew billions of dollars to the money market funds."
729490949,5,"Besides offering yields that are often higher than those of short-term issues, investments in bonds have traditionally attracted those who want to be certain of receiving income for years into the future. Such certainty is not possible with common stocks, whose dividends may be cut or elimlanted, or with money market funds, whose yields can fluctuate widely."
729490950,5,"For example, the investor In a money market fund who was earning a 13 percent yield early in 1982 was receiving less than 9 percent late in the year.

729491009,3,"In conducting our analysis, we have adopted the fundamental assumption that extreme price volatility, such as occurred during the market break, Is undesirable. We recognize that in one sense volatility is a neutral phenomenon: a measure of how quickly prices react to new information. Moreover, during periods of increased economic uncertainty it is not surprising that increased volatility occurs."
729491010,,"Nevertheless, when price swings reach extreme levels, they can have a number of adverse consequences. First, such volatility increases market-making risks and requires market intermediaries to charge more for their liquidity services, thereby reducing the liquidity of the market as a whole."
729491011,,THE loans offered by state-chartered mortgage agencies have lost some of their appeal since savings banks and other conventional lenders began aggressively promoting their own exceptionally low interest rates last fall.
729491012,1,"These agencies have traditionally helped moderate-income buyers by offering mortgages at below-market rates, raising funds by issuing tax-exempt bonds. In some cases,' however, rates are available in the private sector that are as low as those offered by the government agencies."
729491013,,"Moreover, new restrictions on the use of tax-exempt bonds in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 spawned rumors that such loans would no longer be available and created the impression that it would be a waste of time to seek them this year."
729491014,1,"In fact, however, not only are these agencies finding new ways to remain in business, but they also are relaxing their guidelines so that more people and properties should be eligible this year. They will also be gradually lowering their rates, so the traditional benefits of below-market-cost financing should still make their offerings worth exploring."
729491015,,"Their fixed-rate loans also provide safer vehicles for borrowers whose future income may be uncertain. For example, John Mendoza, a chef, and his wife, Ruth, who just bought their fin: home in East Hartford, Conn., for $95,000, chose an agency loan rather than a bank loan last fall even though the banks were offering slightly better terms for a variable-rate loan."
729491016,1,"With stock prices heading downstairs clippety-clop this last week, worried Wall Street market men were wondering if the Federal Reserve Board would be comine to their aid with a cut in margin requirements ‰ЫУ the amount of cash needed to support credit purchases of stock."
729491017,,"But all week the central banking authorities were as inscrutable as ever. There was little doubt in anyone‰ЫЄs mind in Washington, however, that William McChesney Martin and his six fellow governors of the Reserve Board were keeping a close eye on the developments of this last week that shook the lower end of Manhattan‰ЫУ‰Ыў with echoes heard around the world."
729491018,3,"The Federal Reserve authorities have come to the aid of falling stock prices by relaxing credit requirements five times since World War II. The cuts were made in 1947, 1949, 1953, 1958 and 1960. The lowest margin level has been 50 per cent, and the highest (in 1947, but not since then) 100 per cent."
729491019,,"A 100 per cent margin level means no margin at all. It means that purchasers of stock must pay cash on the barrelhead for securities that catch their fancy. When the margin level is 70 per cent, it means that a purchaser with $1,000"
729491020,,"Tile present margin level is 70 per cent; where it has been since July 28, 1960. The Federal .Reserve Board controls margins under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In raising or lowering margin, the monetary authorities restrict or expand what some Wall Street observers call ‰ЫПthe credit content of the market.‰Ыќ"
729491021,3,"The slow, steady decline in bond yields over the last six months or so has pushed long-term interest rates to within shouting distance of their lowest levels of the 1980‰ЫЄs."
729491022,4,"Mindful of the trend, a number of credit market analysts say that the bulk of the drop in bond yields has taken place and that the next sustained move, starting sometime next year, will take yields higher. But others are not so sure, contending that long-term interest rates can come down still further, even if the economy does not go into recession."
729491023,1,"For a period in the spring of 1986, long-term bond yields fell below 7.50 percent before beginning an upward climb that took them to just under 10.25	percent just before the stock market crash of October 1987. Before the 1986 period, bond yields had not been so low since the mid-1970's."
729491024,,"For the past two months yields on the Treasury‰ЫЄs 8% percent bonds of 2019 have been hovering around 8 percent, with brief forays down toward the 7.75 percent level."
729491025,4,"In the aftermath of a price drop chiefly related to the sale of $2.5 billion of 40-year bonds by the Tennessee Valley Authority late Friday, the bellwether issue was offered at a price to yield 7.93 percent."
729491026,3,The securities industry took steps last week to deal with the monster of soaring stock-market volume and its related specter of excessive speculation.
729491027,,"Starting tomorrow, the nation's leading stock exchanges and the over-the-counter market will close at 2 P.M., 90 minutes earlier than usual, for an indefinite period."
729491028,,"This near-crisis move, which follows a string of nine similar shorter sessions last August, is aimed at chopping down the mountain of paperwork in brokerage-house back offices. The main trouble area is the receipt and delivery of securities in cashier 'cages.‰Ыќ ‰ЫПThe back-office problem is worse than ever now,"" one partner declared. ‰ЫПI‰ЫЄm not sure that shorter hours are the answer, but something had to be done or the whole mechanism was in danger of breaking down.

Ind., April 15‰ЫУ Except for scattered ""adjustments of excesses,‰Ыќ already under way, there is no evidence that a period of economic recession may be expected at any time in the immediate future, according to a group of top banking executives from sixj key areas of the nation. The bankers, among those attending the executive council sessions of the American Bankers Association here, stated today that the earlier forecasts of certain economic observers that a recession would develop this spring have now been disproven."
729491033,4,"Although conceding that there had been a marked ""shakeout‰Ыќ in soft goods lines, the bankers declared that they were unconcerned over the development, and were continuing their own activities in a normal fashion without exercising any more than the usual caution."
729491034,,"The bankers, whose home areas included the West Coast, the Southwest, the South, the Middle West and New England as well as New York, stated that they had observed no popular fears of recession, although they agreed that greater selectivity on the part of buyers was evident. People, whether farmers, industrialists or consumers* are now taking a more realistic view of prices, demanding a better return for their dollars, but, and perhaps most importantly, there is no actual unwilling-! ness to spend, they said."
729491035,8,"In all areas, it was agreed, sales of consumers‰ЫЄ durable goods are] holding firm, and consumer credit is on the rise. Business loans are also expanding, it was said, and competition among the banks seeking to make loans continues keen in most areas. There is no apparent unemployment problem, the bankers stated, but the wartime shortage of qualified personnel continues."
729491036,4,"While the volume of individual business operations is not to be compared with the wartime peaks, current activity is generally satisfactory, they asserted. Obviously, unless there is to be serious inflation, the wartime price levels must be further adjusted, \yith the con- < sequent deflationary effects, the bankers declared. But the nation : now appears to be moving along ! on a kind of economic plateau, they said, and at present, at least, there is no sign that it will drop off."

729491047,6,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 UP)‰ЫУ The Federal Reserve Board is considering proposals that it lift the 2\'i per cent ceiling on interest paid by commercial banks on savings deposits, a board spokesman said today."
729491048,,"A number of banks have requested the action, but the spokesman gave no indication whether the board looked on it with favor."
729491049,,"Behind the requests, officials explained, is a feeling in the banking industry that savings and loan associations can lurei away bank customers because of! the higher interest rate they! can pay."
729491050,,"The 2H per cent ceiling has prevailed since the early Nineteen Thirties, when Congress, to prevent hazardous competition among banks for depositors, banned the payment of interest on checking accounts and authorized a limit on the earnings rate of savings deposits."
729491051,3,"Officials said that many bankers did not support the movement for a higher ceiling. The rate of interest on savings accounts varies from area to area and from bank to bank.

729491077,,Good investor demand for a new $6 billion issue of five-year Treasury notes helped the bond market end the day yesterday with price gains of about half a point. Short term interest rates declined slightly.
729491078,3,"The average yield of 11.37 percent for the new 11% percent Treasury notes due Feb. 15, 1989, was down from 11.79 percent at the previous such auction in Augusc, and was less than the 11.4 percent yield estimated by some dealers a few hours before the auction. Another sign of investor and speculative demand for the new notes was the $17.8 billion of bids submitted for the notes, up from $12.1 billion at the previous auction."
729491079,6,"By late in the day, the bellwether 12 percent Treasury bonds due in 2013 were offered at 103 3/32, up % point, to yield 11.62 percent. The new 11% percent notes due in 1989, meanwhile, improved enough so that they were offered with a yield of 11.32 percent compared with an average of 11.37 percent at the auction."
729491080,6,"Richard Davis, director of fixed income research at the First Boston Corporation noted that demand for the five-year issue was helped be- cause investors in Treasury securities can earn sharply higher yields by investing in the five-year issue rather than bills or notes with a shorter maturity. Because many market participants are fearful that rates may rise in the near future, he added, five-year notes ""could also appeal to investors who are shortening the maturity of their investments.‰Ыќ"
729491081,8,"An investor could, for example, sacrifice some income by shifting from a 36-year Treasury bond yielding about 11% percent to a five year note yielding about 11% percent, but would be less exposed to price declines if interest rates were to rise. For example, if yields rose half a percentage point, the price of the five-year notes would fall only about two points, or $20 per $1,000 bond, while the 30-year bond‰ЫЄs price would fall about four points, or $40 per $1,000 bond."

729491087,,The sharp drop In bond yields and rise in bond prices in recent months is a tremendous benefit to many local governments and corporations that are using the opportunity to refinance outstanding bonds sold when interest rates were much higher.
729491088,3,"Billions of dollars worth of old bonds are candidates for refinancing, and investors should not expect to hold until maturity bonds with a coupon, or stated interest rate, two percentage points or more above current interest rates for similar issues."

Stork, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, a Chicago-based subsidiary of the Security Pacific Corporation that specializes in credit analysis."
729491090,7,"Techniques of refinancing vary from issue to issue, but the aim is usually the same ‰ЫУ reduce interest expenses by replacing high-interest bonds with low-interest bonds. Corporations benefit because reduced interest expenses mean higher profits, and local governments and agencies benefit because lower interest costs mean more money for other uses or maybe even lower taxes."
729491091,1,"Investors, however, may not be pleased by refinancings of corporate bonds, especially if they decide to reinvest their money in new bonds at a time when interest rates have declined. Investors‰ЫЄ distress may be alleviated if the old bonds are bought at a price well above par, but there are circumstances in which companies can retire bonds at face value. A research report by the First Boston Corporation noted that many utility bonds can be retired at par through sinking-fund payments or if the company sells assets."

By the first quarter of this year, households earned $680 billion of interest but paid only $320 billion."
729491260,4,"The gap means that when rates fall, the decline in income is greater than the decline in savings.

The surpluses helped restrain booms and the deficits helped cushion the recession and aid recovery.

As national income falls, for example, the yield of the personal income tax falls also, while payments for unemployment compensation rise. Consequently the absolute decline in income available for spending is less than the absolute decline in national income. As national income rises the opposite effect takes place. Tax receipts rise and unemployment compensation payments drop. These cushioning effects happen automatically without administrative or legislative interference.

729491469,,"In 1973, when he was first elected mayor, Ed Hanna promised to turn Utica, a sooty and disheveled city on the Mohawk River, into ""a wonderful and beautiful place to live.‰Ыќ Considering the condition it was in, this would have required something on the order of a miracle. When the knitting mills moved South in the 1930's, jobs became so scarce that nearly 20 percent of Utica's population eventually left town. The rate of unemployment among the 90,000 who stayed was the second highest in the state, with 10 percent of the work force chronically unemployed. Along Genesee Street, the city's main drag, storefronts displayed practically as many ‰ЫПFor Rent‰Ыќ signs as ads for merchandise. The one hotel had closed its doors, and outside of a few patrons at the lone movie house and several couples hanging around Critic‰ЫЄs Lounge waiting for a 350-pound stripper called ‰ЫПElephant Woman,"" at night the central city was almost deserted."
729491470,,"Utica did have one of the first urban renewal projects in the country‰ЫУa 1950's plan to tear down some old buildings and erect a modern office, shopping mall and hotel complex. But after two decades of squabbling and mismanagement, the city had nothing to show for it but a seven-acre mud-hole and parking lot in the middle of its central business district. As for political leadership, the city government had traditionally been a jungle of cronyism and petty graft."
729491471,1,"When Utica took to cutting down its dying elms, for instance, the Parks Department listed many of them in its records as ‰ЫПRepublican‰Ыќ or ‰ЫПDemocrat,"" according to whose house they stood in front of. Then, depending on which party was in office, certain trees got chopped down and others didn‰ЫЄt."
729491472,,"The influx of new lawyers Is evident from the Increasing number of lawsuits filed against companies: Enron, or its executives, alone has been hit by 45 securities lawsuits, Adelphia by 56 and Tyco by 60."
729491473,,"Lawyers for companies and investors alike said the increased interest in shareholder lawsuits might have been inevitable. There have been too many enormous, well-publicized corporate scandals of late, it is easy to attract clients over the Internet, and the potential legal fees are staggering."
729491474,1,"""We're in a relatively unique time,"" said Lawrence A. Sucharow, president of the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys and a partner at Goodklnd Labaton Rudoff & Sucharow, because the confluence of widespread scandal, the speculative bubble and a large pool of burned investors has created a unique opportunity. ‰ЫПThe losses of any one of these cases may have equaled the market drop of all the cases in any other year, because the stocks were pumped up so much by the bubble,"" he said."
729491475,,"S.	Lerach of Milberg Weiss Ber-shad Hynes & Lerach ‰ЫУ say the new competitors are not a serious threat to them. But they concede that the new lawyers are changing legal tactics and sometimes setting off fierce battles to control big lawsuits. For now, lawyers say, there are plenty of targets to go around."
729491476,3,"After all, millions of angry investors have lost billions of dollars, and there are many to blame: corporations, fat-cat executives, boards, lawyers, accountants and financial advisers, as well as the investment bankers who played games with stock offerings and the analysts who talked up the stock price of corporate lemons."
729491477,7,"The stock market last week scored a moderate advance in continued heavy trading despite some bearish economic developments. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 7.43 to 887.63, it highest level in 10 months."
729491478,6,Analysts said that the market in the last two weeks has been consolidating its sharp gains registered since the summer rally began in June. Since then the blue chip barometer has soared about 65 points. The upswing has been fueled mainly by heavy institutional buying.
729491479,,Many analysts contend that the stock market‰ЫЄs consolidation likely will end soon after Labor Day if only because of the need for the cash-rich institutions to enter the market again in force.
729491480,,Wall Street took in stride unfavorable economic news last week. This included an increase in the prime rate by many of the nation‰ЫЄs banks to a record 12>/4 percent from 12 percent.
729491481,1,Another depressant was the Government‰ЫЄs report that the July index of leading economic indicators fell four-tenths of 1 percent. It was the third decline in the index in four months and indicated a deepening economic slowdown.
729491482,7,The decline in oil prices that helped bring inflation in the United States down to an annual rate of 3 percent may be ending.
729491483,6,"Many oil analysts and economists are suggesting that the sharp price increases this year, which have brought the price of oil up nearly $6, to about $20 a barrel, are going to hold. Some others contend that they see signs that point to rising oil prices for the rest of this decade."
729491484,,"""Using a very reasonable set of assumptions, I can foresee several years of price Increases after 1995,"" said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director at the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington."
729491485,4,"‰ЫП1 personally think demand will be exploding because of a rapid coincidence of demand in the Far East, Europe and North America,‰Ыќ he said. ‰ЫПAnd at current prevailing prices, I don't think the global oil industry is ready to accommodate a synchronized push in demand.‰Ыќ"
729491486,,"Demand Growth Increasing An executive at an oil trading company, who asked not to be identified, said the calculus looked like this: ‰ЫПTotal production is about 70 million barrels a day. Demand growth is increasing by 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day, per annum, the equivalent of Kuwait's current annual production. The big supply sources over the past few years are coming to an end, and for the first time anyone can remember, OPEC has no substantial excess capacity.‰Ыќ"
729491487,7,"The prices of Treasury securities, after holding steady yesterday on the release of weak data on second-quarter economic growth, fell when a report showed consumer sentiment was stronger than had been expected."
729491488,6,"The University of Michigan‰ЫЄs final consumer sentiment index for July rose to 94.4, from 92.7 in June. The Michigan index is a component of the Government‰ЫЄs leading economic indicators, and is seen as a sign of future consumer spending for homes and durable goods."
729491489,,"""However, it‰ЫЄs not merely a measure of whether people will spend, because they will continue to buy the necessities no matter how they feel, but it's a measure of their willingness to take on debt,‰Ыќ said Elliott Platt, director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ‰ЫПThe better they feel, the more willing they are.‰Ыќ"
729491490,1,"Bond prices also fell because of supply pressure, as traders pondered government, municipal and corporate plans to issue debt. Next week the Treasury will announce the size of its quarterly borrowing."
729491491,,"The 30-year bond dropped 25/32, or $7.81 for $1,000 of bonds, to a price of 1094/32 and a yield of 6.90 percent, up from 6.84 percent on Thursday."
729491492,,"The credit markets plummeted yesterday, driving interest rates on Treasury and corporate bonds to their highest levels in financial history as investors became increasingly convinced that the Federal Government had decided to abandon the fight against inflation."
729491493,3,"New three-and-a-half-year Treasury notes sold at a record yield of 11.98 percent and Bell System bonds at a record 12.70	percent. Some long-term bond prices plunged more than 2 points, giant declines by the normal standards of the credit markets."

729491495,,"Prices of fixed-income securities have declined almost without interruption since early January as investors have shifted to the view that the economy is not headed into a recession and that demand for borrowed funds will remain strong. Furthermore, the Government‰ЫЄs budget message convinced many that no headway would soon be made in dampening inflation."
729491496,7,"In addition yesterday, the Federal Reserve temporarily withdrew some reserves from the banking system, and its action may have helped depress bond prices, some dealers said. Later, the General Motors Corporation reported increased automobile sales in late January, and that sign of economic strength also may have hurt the bond market."
729491497,4,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 ‰ЫУ The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, strongly implied today that the central bank would break with tradition and raise interest rates before revived inflation became clearly visible."
729491498,5,"But Mr. Greenspan left unclear, as is his custom, how close or how large a ""pre-emptive strike‰Ыќ might be. Wall Street analysts were divided in their interpretation of his remarks to Congressional committee members and answers to their questions."
729491499,2,"while low rates were vital to continued expansion, he would not object to a modest increase if the move did not make mortgages and other long-term borrowing more expensive. If the Fed should ""make that decision on shortterm rates, what I hope is it won‰ЫЄt raise long-term rates because there‰ЫЄs no need to do it,‰Ыќ the President said."
729491500,7,"In financial markets, stocks continued to rally, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 32.93 points and approaching the 4,000 mark. The bond market apparently focused on Mr. Greenspan‰ЫЄs failure to offer a timetable for taking action on inflation, and prices edged higher. The dollar eased on Mr. Greenspan‰ЫЄs remarks."
729491501,4,"vance of a policy meeting io set' interest rate policy for the year, Mr. Greenspan said that ‰ЫПregrettably‰Ыќ the Fed had frequently erred in the past by waiting too. long to combat inflation, which often accompanies rapid economic growth."
729491502,4,A WAVE of refinancings and new mortgage applications have swamped lend-Lers in recent weeks as interest rates have slid to record lows.
729491503,4,"‰ЫПIt‰ЫЄs pandemonium,"" said Ellen Feld-schreiber, a partner with the Manhattan Mortgage Company. ""We have people who are refinancing who refinanced last year, and even six months ago."""
729491504,4,"The national average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell slightly, to 7.55 percent for the week ended March 26, according to preliminary figures from HSH Associates in Butler, N.J., which surveys 2,000 lenders nationwide each week."
729491505,9,"The average interest rate had been 7.65 percent at the end of the previous week, but it stood at 7.52 percent for the week ending March 12 and 7.51 percent, the lowest rate since May 1973, for the week ended March 5."
729491506,6,"The up-twice, down-once pattern follows 17 consecutive weeks of falling average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages, going back to the week ended Nov. 13, 1992, when the average rale was 8.54 percent."
729491507,7,"JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 28 ‰ЫУ By publicly challenging the views of his boss on the mission of the Federal Reserve Bank, the agency‰ЫЄs vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, touched off a dispute that could lead to clashes eral Reserve's annual conference here on Saturday, Mr. Blinder called for central banks around the world, including the Fed, to set Interest rates so as to pursue low inflation and low unemployment."
729491508,3,"In the past, however, the agency's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has called for an interest rate policy that focuses on low inflation alone."
729491509,5,"Though the disagreement fs largely theoretical now, it makes It likely that the nation‰ЫЄs two top central bankers would take different positions on interest rates if unemployment rose. Who Wins will affect the interest rates that Americans pay on credit cards, car loans and home mortgages."
729491510,1,"Unemployment in the United States, which was at 6.1 percent in July, was already so low that Mr. Blinder said a further drop might stoke inflation, which has been running at nearly 3 percent annually. The Federal Reserve has already raised short-term interest rates five times this year, and Mr. Blinder has endorsed those moves."
729491511,4,"But economists here predicted that If unemployment rose, Mr. Blinder would be more reluctant than many of his colleagues to raise rates further, producing clashes about policy."
729491512,4,"The stock market, confronted with the news of another rise in the unemployment rate, finished lower yesterday for the fifth consecutive session."
729491513,4,"At the opening, the Labor Department reported that the nation‰ЫЄs unemployment rate climbed half a percentage point to 8.7 per cent in March, its highest level since 1941."
729491514,3,It was the sixth straight month of higher unemployment and was another indication that the recession was widening. The Government agency said that eight million persons were unemployed in March.
729491515,5,"Another depressant was the fact that the First National j City Bank, a trendsetter, left ‰РК its prime rate- unchanged at 7 }4 per cent for the coming week. The market's sharp advance since mid-December has been attributed mainly to the decrease in Interest rates."
729491516,4,"Prices on the New York Stock Exchange opened lower and continued in the minus column throughout the session. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 4.93 points at 747.26. Its high for the day was posted at 12:30 P.M. when the average was down 1.56 points."
729491517,4,"SINCE mid-July, when stock .market averages began drooping, investors have been worriedly watching and wondering what the professionals think about the major markets. Then came Iraq‰ЫЄs invasion of Kuwait. Now, the questions for institutional portfolio managers, the driving force behind the markets in this country, are obviously much more urgent."
729491518,,"Michael C. Aronstein, a partner of Comstock Partners, a New York investment firm that manages about $2 billion for individual and institutional clients, has been bearish on the outlook for stocks and bonds for almost two years. And the recent events in the Middle East have not changed his outlook. He and his partners are so negative on the worldwide markets that they have 90 percent of their clients‰ЫЄ assets parked in short-term obligations of the United States and foreign governments. And his outlook on the real estate market is so bleak that he rents both of his homes. Meanwhile, as the Standard & Poor‰ЫЄs 500 index has gone down about 8 percent since the beginning of the year, the Dreyfus Capital Value Fund, a mutual fund managed by Comstock, is up about 2 percent."
729491519,3,"Gerald R. Jordan, founding partner of the Hellman-Jordan Management Company, which invests $1.3 billion for pension funds, sold almost $300 million of stocks when the Dow Jones industrial average hit 3,000 in July.

But the price of oil is not going to stay at $30 a barrel. I‰ЫЄm willing to make a bet with anybody that we‰ЫЄre going to see oil at $20 before we see it at $40. War would be about the most bullish thing for the market because it would resolve the uncertainty."
729491520,,"Mr. Nicholas: The one thing this has created is an increased likelihood of recession. I think we were already headed for super slow growth and recession and this has just increased the probability. But when the general economy is slow, growth stocks do well."
729491521,4,"Mr. Jordan: This has to be a buying opportunity. Markets make bottoms on bad news and people who buy stocks on good news are late. Even if we are going into a depression, we have to rally first. The market is already discounting a doubling of the price of oil, war, a recession and higher interest rates. The risk has been taken out of the stock market. What most people don‰ЫЄt understand is that psychology plays such an important part. There is widespread fear, and I suspect it is going to increase over the next couple of weeks."
729491522,,"Prices of Government notes and bonds moved sharply lower in heavy trading yesterday, as credit market participants delivered a decidedly negative response to the news that Paul A. Volcker would not seek a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board."
729491523,5,"The bulk of the reaction was seen in the price of long-term Government securities, which are viewed as more speculative instruments because of their maturity dates."
729491524,4,"The most dramatic decline was registered in the price of the Treasury‰ЫЄs bellwether 8.75 percent, 30-year bond. By late in the day, the 30-year issue was down by more than 3 points, or more than $30 for each $1,000 face value of securities, to an offer of 98 1/ 16, to yield 8.93 percent."

729491539,3,"Given the uncertainties, Mr. Greenspan said, it was ‰ЫПmuch too soon to conclude‰Ыќ that the threat of a destabilizing surge in prices and wages had receded.

729491571,7,"There was further indication that the national economy was perking up. Last month, according to a Government report, industrial production rose. Copper prices were increased by a leading producer. A Treasury advance refunding operation was successful beyond expectations."
729491572,7,Falling interest rates proved to be a rising tide that lifted the performance of all mutual funds investing in bonds in the last quarter.
729491573,7,"Although all categories of bond mutual funds turned in positive performances in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, data compiled by Lipper Analytical Services showed that many did much better than others, depending on the type of bonds the funds had bought. In figuring the performance of each fund, Lipper measures the change in asset value of a share in each fund, plus reinvested dividends."
729491574,6,"The best-performing funds by a wide margin were those investing in zero-coupon Treasury bonds with long-term maturities, known as target maturity funds. Returns for that group averaged 9.27 percent, but were much higher for the several funds of the Benham Group of Mountain View, Calif. Benham funds accounted for four of the top five performers in the quarter."
729491575,,"David Schroeder, portfolio manager for the Benham target maturity funds, noted that the long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds his funds buy always perform strongly when bond yields are declining. He added, though, that the strong gains in the past quarter did not attract many new buyers, because investors seemed more willing to take their profits than to make new investments in ant icipation of further declines."

After an opening in which United States Steel and Reynolds Tobacco ‰ЫПB‰Ыќ were down fractions on 1,500 and 2,500 shares, respectively, and Royal Dutch and St. Paul up fractions on similar blocks, action centered in the cigarette makers.

729491583,3,"""I wish it were going better,‰Ыќ ‰ЫўDr. Burns said at a luncheon meeting of New York Times reporters and editors. ‰ЫПIt appears that they‰ЫЄre not within their financial guidelines, and people who follow it closely are seriously concerned.‰Ыќ"
729491584,6,"Last week, Secretary Simon expressed general satisfaction with the city's finances, said that there was a ‰ЫПreasonable prospect‰Ыќ that the city would repay its loan, and added that deficiencies alleged in a report made by Arthur Anderson & Company ‰ЫПappear to be based on the erroneous assumption that the three-year plan is immutable."
729491585,4,"He declined to comment, however, on what the Federal reaction would be if the cit'-failed to repay its loans. Repayment is due in June, and is required by law before additional funds can be extended."

729491587,5,"WASHINGTON, July 2 ‰ЫУ Now comes the endgame in the 20 Years War between Democrats and Republicans, Treasury Secretaries and Federal Reserve chairmen, and lobbyists from three of the nation‰ЫЄs most powerful industries over legislation to overhaul the financial system."
729491588,2,"Business interests and Government agencies, in a situation reminiscent of the trench warfare of an earlier era, spent years fighting to a stalemate over the legislation. The lawmakers benefited mightily in the process, using the battle among insurers, bankers and securities firms to enrich their campaign coffers by hundreds of millions of dollars. Until two -months ago, they had delivered very little in return."
729491589,6,"Now, however, the financial industry‰ЫЄs investment may be paying off. With the House of Representatives‰ЫЄ overwhelming approval on Thursday of a banking bill that would repeal 65 years of laws intended to bar banks, insurers and securities underwriters from entering one another‰ЫЄs businesses, there is a growing consensus that this year might be different. The Clinton Administration generally likes the House legislation, and that increases the odds that a new law will be passed."
729491590,2,"‰ЫПWe were very pleased with the bill, the overwhelming majority that supported it and the clear sign of what can happen when the Administration works with both sides of the aisle,‰Ыќ said Gary Gensler, a Treasury Under Secretary. ‰ЫПThere is finally a real chance for meaningful reform.‰Ыќ"
729491591,,"But it will still take what was once unthinkable for the legislation to become reality: an agreement between Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and President Clinton."
729491592,4,The stock market last week suffered its first general decline in more than two months. It ran into an expected squall of profit taking after Its steady ascent to new peaks. '
729491593,,"Although the setback engulfed virtually the whole list of stocks, the financial community was encouraged by the fact that the retreat so far has been of fairly modest proportions and has not been accompanied by any obviously panicky selling pressure."

729491596,1,"The steel issues ' also lost ground, despite the rather sharp production upturn (3.3 per cent) reported at the start of the week. Nonferrous metal stocks, however, ran counter to the trend and chalked up some gains after producers posted price increases, notably the lucent a pound rise on aluminum iingots by the whole industry.,"
729491597,,"Bond prices shot up again yesterday amid widespread expectations that the recent erosion of interest rates would continue well into 1986. Indeed, as investors rushed to lock in current yields, long-term bond prices climbed almost a point, with the Government bonds with the longest maturities trading at their highest levels since early 1980."
729491598,,"But the general belief that the Federal Reserve would soon cut its discount rate, perhaps as early as Friday, had little impact on Treasury bills and other short-term money markets. Several dealers noted that short-term rates had already discounted a cut in the discount rate to 7 percent from its current level of 7.5 percent."
729491599,6,"Another example of the credit market‰ЫЄs bullish mood came when the Treasury auctioned $9.5 billion of two-year notes with a 7% percent coupon at an average price of 99.90. This produced the lowest average yield, 7.93	percent, since May 1978, when the average yield was 7.80 percent. At last month‰ЫЄs regular sale of this maturity, the average yield was 8.58 percent and a year ago it was 9.92 percent."
729491600,7,"Today, the Treasury will auction $7 billion of four-year notes. Late yesterday, these notes were traded at a yield of 8.32 percent on a when-issued basis."
729491601,4,"Meanwhile, the credit market received two additional stimulants yesterday. One was the report that housing starts in November dropped 12.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis. Many economists had expected that at worst there would be no change from October. As interpreted by the credit market, it means reduced demand for mortgage money, a factor that usually influences the over all interest rates."
729491602,4,"WASHINGTON, March 27‰ЫУ ,The unemployment figures for March have been gathered in the outlying precincts. They will' be computed and published in a week or two. If they show another increase, political pressures for more economic stimulants will rise, too, for serious unemployment is bad politics."
729491603,,"The lack of a job is always serious for the individual. It is so serious that his view of the economic situation is not always objective or comprehensive, as illustrated by a slightly worn but compelling observation: ‰ЫПWhen the fellow next door loses his job, it‰ЫЄs a recession. When you lose .yours, it‰ЫЄs a depression.‰Ыќ"
729491604,3,"‰ЫПWhile it . is obvious that no individual‰ЫЄs plight makes a problem at the national level, it is equally obvious that a number of individuals with a common plight does become a national problem that calls for remedial action. What that number is, no one will officially say. Any number would be attacked at once as too high and too low. Besides, there is something absurd about an official putting himself into, or near, the position of saying that 3,999,999 unemployed is not a national problem, but 4,000,000 is."
729491605,3,"' Nevertheless, there is a sort of jline that some officials regard as the edge of the trouble zone. That zone is reached when six out of every 100 workers is out of a job. The country is on the edge of that now, or was in February."
729491606,4,"‰ЫПAn unemployment rate of 3 to 4 per cent [allowing for seasonal variations] has, for many years, been thought to approximate a normal frictional rate‰ЫУthat is, I the rate which could be account-1 ed for by job turnover and the more or less accidental factors of personal adjustment in the la-| bor market."""
729491607,5,The credit markets rebounded somewhat yesterday following an indication that the Federal Reserve System wants to keep the Federal funds rate at 9% percent or below.
729491608,4,"in tne tax-exempt municipal markets, however, prices were under downward pressure as fears of tighter monetary‰ЫЄ policy combined with prospects of extremely heavy offerings of new issues in the coming month. Some analysts predicted that about $2.6 billion in new municipal issues would be offered within the next 30 days."
729491609,4,"Eight tax-exempt issues were brought to market yesterday and one dealer described market response as ""mediocre.‰Ыќ Only about half the bonds in each issue were sold."
729491610,4,"As a result, a $250 million bond issue by the Texas Municipal Power Agency, which is to be offered today, was repriced downward yesterday to yield 9Vg percent. The issue, being underwritten by Salomon Brothers, was originally priced at 8% percent on Monday."
729491611,,"The $300 million in 39-year debentures of the New York Telephone Company that are scheduled to be sold today were priced late yesterday to yield 11.76 percent.

729491612,,"With long-term interest rates now above 7 percent, President Clinton‰ЫЄs top economic advisers expressed concern over the weekend that further rate increases could damage the economy and slow growth to an unacceptable level.'"
729491613,4,"The Administration argues that the economy is going through a transition from very strong growth in last year's fourth quarter to less growth now. But no one can tell where the leveling-off point will be. The concern is that if interest rates rise another notch, economic growth could decline too much ‰ЫУ slowing the creation of new jobs."
729491614,,"""Based on what we know, our view of how strongly the economy will ‰Ыў grow this year is not changed by an interest rate in the neighborhood of 7 percent,‰Ыќ said Laura D‰ЫЄAndrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the President‰ЫЄs Council of Economic Advisers. ""But if the level goes much above 7 percent, then that would exercise a contractionary effect on the economy.‰Ыќ"
729491615,,"Long-term interest rates rose nearly three-quarters of a percentage point during the last month, reaching 7.26	percent on Friday in a bondtrading session shortened in observance of Good Friday. Not since the early 1980‰ЫЄs have rates increased so much in a single month, and the comments by Ms. Tyson and other Administration officials seemed clearly aimed at calming the markets."
729491616,2,"The Administration‰ЫЄs new concerns could put it in open conflict for the first time with the Federal Reserve Board, whose chief priority has been to control inflation even at the cost of economic growth.

729491629,,"This is not a challenge to military programs, no matter how expensive, that are clearly vital to the security of the nation, but it is an assertion that the well-being of the people can also be threatened by economic insecurity and environmental pollution, and it is a challenge to the notion that the Government can get anything it wants merely by asking for it in the name of technological progress or national prestige."

729491719,4,"The bonds‰ЫЄ appeal resides in one significant feature. Unlike regular bonds, TIPS have interest rates with two effective components: one fixed, the other tied to inflation, as measured twice a year by the Consumer Price Index. If inflation rises ‰ЫУ as it did in March, with an unexpectedly big price jump of 0.5 percent ‰ЫУ so, eventually, does the bond‰ЫЄs yield and principal. But if inflation declines, then the yield and principal value of the bond also falls, though an investor will recoup no less than the par principal amount at maturity."

In addition, the Treasury issues I-bonds ‰ЫУ savings bonds that come with a fixed interest rate plus a variable, inflation-adjusted component.

Others, however, caution that production lost during an auto strike could be made up after a settlement is reached, when economic activity would rebound strongly."
729491789,7,"W. Lee Hoskins, chief economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh, estimated that each week of a strike at G.M. would reduce economic growth by about one-half percentage point. ‰ЫПA strike that lasts well into the fourth quarter could easily halt economic growth or even cause a temporary decline,‰Ыќ he said. Settlement Terms Stressed ‰ЫПDuring the strike period, interest rates could fall,‰Ыќ he said, but added that the ‰ЫПlasting effect of the auto negotiations on interest rates‰Ыќ will come from the terms of the settlement. A wage increase of 10 to 15 percent over three years could help reduce inflationary expectations, the economist said. But a raise of 20 to 25 percent could heighten fears of inflation and drive rates up, he said."

But there are serious .concerns here, on the roads cycle of decline. Higher prices, starting with a 6 per cent increase on May 7, come at a time of stagnating demand: traffic growth that avfiW aged nearly 15 per cent per year through the mid-nineteen sixties has dropped to zero in the current recession. And While the C.A.B. has told the airlines that their prosperity depends on filling, up their now half-empty planes, the board also calculates that the fare increases will turn away more than 6 per cent of the already depressed airline traffic."

729491952,4,"WASHINGTON, May 9 ‰ЫУ Through the cruel lens of hindsight, history seems likely to fault President Carter‰ЫЄs Council of Economic Advisers for underestimating the strength of the economy two years running and for underestimating the virulence of an inflation that has accelerated to a double-digit pace."
729491953,,"Even so, economists in and out ot tne Government say, the three-member council headed by Charles L. Schultze will win laurels in the history books for having brought about an important change in the way the executive branch goes about regulating business. Under Mr. Schultze‰ЫЄs aggressive leadership, the council has inserted the Presidency as a moderating force into the continuing process by which new regulations are planned, drafted and revised."
729491954,4,"With economic policy ‰ЫУ particularly trying to stop inflation ‰ЫУ looming as the paramount domestic issue in the 1980 Presidential campaign, the Council of Economic Advisers plays a more central role in the Government than it has in many years. Since the council has no statutory powers other than to advjse the President, much depends on the personalities and abilities of its three members, particularly the chairman, who is first among eqtlals."
729491955,3,"An attempt to assess the performance of the present council after two and a half years ‰ЫУ Mr. Schultze began advising President-elect Carter in the late autumn of 1976 ‰ЫУ leads to these findings: ‰ЫўIThe council underestimated in 1977 and again in 1978 the strength of the economy and the rate of inflation (as did some other forecasters), forcing the President twice to modify in the spring the stimulative tax cuts he had proposed in the winter.

729491998,,This weakness reflects the switch from an artificial cheap-money policy to one of letting interest rates seek their own levels. Now that Government anxiety to check inflationary influences is also shown by its willingness to abandon this cheap money policy as regards non-public loans.

729492008,,"But this posthumous work raises an interesting and vaguely disturbing question having to do with the fact that it was published so late, four full decades after it was serialized in its original Yiddish in The Jewish Daily Forward and seven years after Singer‰ЫЄs death. Indeed, the circumstantial evidence tends to support the notion that Singer was less than enthusiastic about that particular book. If that is the case, why?"
729492009,,"It happens that I gave ‰ЫПShadows on the Hudson‰Ыќ what is commonly considered a rave review. I found it to be one of Singer‰ЫЄs masterpieces, full of dark power and narrational momentum, with caustically intelligent troubling and troubled characters. Not all critics were as generous as I was. Indeed, a critic in a review that has yet to appear deems ‰ЫПShadows‰Ыќ a failure that should not have been published at all. I do not agree, but I have been wondering whether, paradoxically. Singer felt the same way as the less generous critics, especially about the book‰ЫЄs not being published."

Slower growth in basic money supply in May, and the prospect for slow growth in June, should lead the Fed to provide enough reserves to result in a rate of 12'/i percent to 13(4 percent for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market, they said, down from 14.67 percent and 14.97 percent in the weeks ended May 19 and May 12."
729492045,3,"Reserves are deposits that banks are required to maintain at the Fed. When reserves are more available, in- terest rates tend to fall, since banks have less need to borrow in order to keep their reserve account at the level required by the Fed."

729492153,3,"As you know, the economy has been in recession for some months. The recession has some of the characteristics of earlier downturns. But it seems to me plainly wrong to think of the current state of the economy as simply reflecting ‰ЫПanother‰Ыќ recession."
729492154,2,"Rather, we are seeing the culmination of a much longer period of unsatisfactory economic performance extending well back into the 1970‰ЫЄs ‰ЫУ performance marked by poor productivity, growing unemployment, much higher interest rates, and pressures on the real earnings of the average citizen and on the real profits of our businesses."
729492155,2,"A number of factors have contributed to that deterioration in our performance, not all of them completely understood. But one pervasive element ‰ЫУ an element particularly relevant to monetary policy ‰ЫУ stands out:. We found ourselves in the midst of the most prolonged inflation in our history, and that inflationary process had come to feed on itself. Incentives were distorted. Too much of the energy of our citizens was directed toward seeking protection from future price increases and toward speculative activity, and too little toward production. Increasingly depressed and volatile capital markets reflected the uncertainties. Effective tax rates increased as inflation carried taxpayers into higher brackets. But, in a sluggish economy, those revenues did not keep up with our spending plans and programs."
729492156,5,"Against that background, the notion that we might comfortably live with inflation ‰ЫУ or that we could accept inflation in the interest of strong growth ‰ЫУ was exposed as an Illusion. I believe it is fair to say a clear national consensus emerged that turning back inflation had to be a top priority of economic policy ‰ЫУ that a stable dollar is a necessary part of the foundation of a strong economy."

729492159,2,"The recovery was shortlived, and by noon ^ prices began drifting lower on profit taking and from a lack of favorable news developments. The downward trend continued until 1:30 P.M., when some bargain hunting developed and prices finned until the last hour of trading, when they began to ease again."
729492160,6,Brokers noted that some of the late price recovery reflected the afternoon announcement that President Nixon would meet later in the day with Treasury Secretary George

There were the following developments: еЗ3The United States monetary gold stock declined $100-million during the week to $13.3-billion, the lowest since Sept. 7, 1938. The decline, which observers attributed largely to continued purchases of gold by the French Government, brought the total drop in the nation‰ЫЄs monetary gold so far this year to $400-million, compared with a drop of $1,529,000,000 in the 1965 period."

Still, investors were treated to a roller coaster ride in which the Dow, after rising briefly, plunged by 212 points and then climbed 219 before stabilizing in the heaviest trading day ever.

729492182,6,"Personal income continues to climb, says Robert J. Genetski, senior vice president and chief economist of Chicago‰ЫЄs Harris Trust and Savings Bank. But whether the new money means a stronger economy remains a matter of doubt. The added income could flow into savings, rather than into consumer spending, he said."

729492214,7,"Thus, from the point of view of labor, wages rose only mod-icstly but from the point of view of employers the cost of each 'man-hour worked rose fairly sharply.

That was not the case, though, and the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.76 percent, up from 8.57 percent at the last seven-year note sale on July 11.

729492234,6,These improved forecasts come despite consumer spending that slowed before the market plunge and seems to have lost further impetus since.
729492235,4,"But while consumer spending has slowed, it has not dropped as sharply as many economists had feared. As best as economists can determine, people have apparently decided to base their spending on their incomes, not on their assets. And so their losses in the stock market have not dramatically affected their buying habits."

729492238,4,"Few analysts foresee a recession this year, but their message is almost as somber: The period of rapid growth, when countries have the opportunity to restore the jobs and in- vestment lost in the previous recession, has already passed, leaving many countries in a weaker condition to face a decline next year or later."
729492239,3,"During its boom of 1983 and 1984, the huge American economy pulled the rest of the world out of recession by swallowing up hundreds of billions of dollars worth of other countries‰ЫЄ goods.

729492243,5,"But as things turned out, the credit controls have had a substantial impact. According to economists, the credit meas- j ures, which made it somewhat more costly to extend or receive credit, have I prompted millions of Americans to alter j their spending and credit habits. The Federal Reserve program appears to have moved consumers to use their credit cards and charge accounts much less, and it has thereby shaken the buy-now pay-later philosophy that until recently has kept inflation going."

Economists are everywhere sought after, called upon by governments, corporations and the news media to impart meaning to what so often seems frightening and confusing ‰ЫУ from our declining wages and stagnating productivity to our endless trade and budget deficits. So why does economics as a profession seem under siege?"
729492338,,"A recent study by the American Economic Association, for example, found that nearly two-thirds of graduate economics professors consider their calling ‰ЫПoverly mathematical‰Ыќ and ‰ЫПtoo unrelated to the real world.‰Ыќ The number of Americans earning Ph.D.‰ЫЄs in economics has fallen by almost half in the past 20 years, to barely 400 a year."

729492341,,"For Mr. Heilbroner, the Norman Thomas Professor of Economics, Emeritus, at the New School for Social Research, and Mr. Milberg, an assistant professor of economics at the New School, vision is neither a religious nor a mystical experience. It is what Joseph Schumpeter 40 years ago identified in his commanding ‰ЫПHistory of Economic Analysis‰Ыќ as a pre-analytic, pre-theoretical grasp of the central issues each great period in economics is meant to address. Possessed of such vision, economics enters what Mr. Heilbroner and Mr. Milberg call ‰ЫПclassical situations,‰Ыќ extended historical moments when the richness of the central vision gives rise to industrious reflection and analysis that fills out the vision and gives it both power and meaning for its particular age."

729492348,3,"The vote was 216 to 214 Seven Republicans voted against the bill Three Democrats voted for it The narrow margin of victory reflected an intense, often bitter partisan debate on the House floor over how best to encourage recovery from a downturn that began a year ago and intensified after the terrorist attacks last month It also suggested that many of the House bill's provisions were likely to be stripped out or scaled back in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Efforts to negotiate a compromise in the Senate have been faltering, all but ending hopes expressed by both sides of getting a bill signed into law quickly at a time when layoffs are mounting, corporate profits are withering and consumer and investor confidence is fragile The House legislation‰ЫЄs center-piece is a package of corporate tax cuts that would total more than $70 billion this year The bill also includes $28 billion in tax cuts for individuals ‰ЫУ including one-time payments of $600 to couples and $300 to single people whose incomes were too low to receive rebate checks under the tax bill signed into law by President Bush this year ‰ЫУ and $12 billion to help states bolster programs for people who have lost jobs Under pressure from Democrats to explain their focus on companies rather than individuals.

729492377,3,"For nearly two years, the Republican economic rallying cry has been loud, insistent and single-minded: The biggest problem ailing the American economy is the Federal budget deficit, and the season has a way of rewriting political agendas, and Republicans have learned that what once seemed to play well in Washington does not ring many bells elsewhere."
729492378,4,"In recent weeks, a visitor could sit through Rotary Club luncheons in Iowa or New Hampshire and barely hear mention of the deficit.

729492382,,"The recession has heightened public awareness of the fact that, while there has been agreement on the need for full employment, there has been little agreement on just what full employment is, how unemployment should be defined, or on what specific data should be used to make judgments on the performance of the economy."
729492383,7,"There is even disagreement on whether the primary focus should be on the employment or unemployment statistics. The media‰ЫУas well as the professional literature ‰ЫУhas focused mostly on unemployment, and unemployment is the subject of this discussion."

Two of the works, one by Ms Sze and one by Ms Cardiff, are site-specific"
729492434,,"Ms. Sze, a Boston-bom Chinese-Amencan whose installations are created from everyday objects ranging from toothpicks and sponges to pills and light bulbs, is one of today‰ЫЄs hot art stars. Her work was featured at the 2000 Whitney Biennial, the 1999-2000 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh and the 1999 Venice Biennale. She has created perhaps the most complex work in the current show, ‰ЫПThings Fall Apart‰Ыќ (2001), a fractured sport-utility vehicle that cascades down the central staircase and into the museum‰ЫЄs atrium."

729492438,3,"Whenever a financial disaster of this magnitude strikes, the investing public becomes vulnerable to predators. In this case, the high-pressure tactics used against bondholders are very similar to those used against stockholders in the 1960‰ЫЄs ‰ЫУ before the adoption of Securities and Exchange Commission rules for stock tender offers."
729492439,,"To combat these tactics, the S.E.C. needs to extend its rules on stock tender offers to bond tender offers. This is the main thrust of a rule-making petition filed with the S.E.C. by Fidelity Investments and the Prudential Insurance Company. The petition focuses on tender offers by troubled companies to buy back their bonds at deep discounts ‰ЫУ $30 to $40, say, for a $100 bond ‰ЫУ through high-pressure tactics that effectively deprive the bondholders of their right to make an informed choice."
729492440,3,"While the management of a troubled company should be allowed to restructure its outstanding debt in order to avoid bankruptcy, bondholders deserve a fair opportunity to negotiate the terms of the restructuring. Under current S.E.C. rules, however, bondholders are denied most of the rights granted stockholders."
729492441,,"When someone makes a tender offer to the shareholders of a public company, the same price must be offered to each and every shareholder. By contrast, a company may offer to buy bonds from only a selected group of bondholders, or may simultaneously offer to buy bonds at different prices from different groups of bondholders. The S.E.C. should prohibit such discriminatory practices by applying its ‰ЫПoffer to all‰Ыќ and ‰ЫПsame consideration‰Ыќ rules to bond tender offers."

729492444,6,"There has been no general decline in prices despite the broad drops in production and in other major segments of the economy. Industrial production late last summer was running at 145 per cent of the 1947-49 average; by December it had fallen to 136 per cent and there was undoubtedly another dip in January. Over the same period ‰ЫУwhen the economy was obviously moving into a recession stage‰ЫУwholesale and consumer prices continued to rise. The indexes did remain stationary in December and possibly in January. But in all of 1957, wholesale prices rose 1.8 per' cent and consumer prices about 3 per cent."
729492445,8,"This price spiral >has persisted almost unchecked throughout the last two years, through the boom of 1956 and the sharp readjustment of 1957. The wholesale index climbed 5.8 per cent and the consumer average by 6 per cent. At the end. of last year, they were both at new highs."
729492446,1,"It. is true that there have been recent scattered price cuts in various items, such as certain types of stainless steel, building equipment, plywood and cotton textile goods. Reductions in crude and heavy fuel oil have shown up in certain areas."
729492447,1,"The economist, of the country‰ЫЄs leading investment banking firm asserted yesterday that long-term interest rates have passed their peak. Albert M.

729492448,3,"‰ЫПWhile the supply of new issues will probably remain heavy for a while,‰Ыќ he contim ued, ‰ЫПit can be readily absorbed as recognition of the change in the trend in interest rates takes root. Next year, with capital spending down, new issues will be fewer.‰Ыќ"
729492449,6,Mr. Wojnilower‰ЫЄs view of the bond market outlook is especially noteworthy because he has been bearish on bond prices and interest rates most of the time since he joined the firm in 1963.

729492454,,"After close consultations with West Germany‰ЫЄs Bundesbank, the French central bank announced a package of measures, including a cut in interest rates, that it said was intended to make the French franc less attractive to foreign speculators and push footloose funds back into West Germany to strengthen the mark."
729492455,6,"The reason for the measures, French officials said, was the dollar‰ЫЄs latest surge on world currency markets following President Carter‰ЫЄs defeat last Tuesday and the one-point rise, to 15>еЈ percent, in the prime rate by big American banks at the end of the week. The resultant downward pressure on the German mark has strained the fixed exchange rate that West Germany and France maintain between their currencies under the European Monetary System,"
729492456,,"Meanwhile, the dollar continued its ascent against all other major Western currencies on European money markets today, while the price of gold fell sharply, slumping below $600 an ounce for the first time in five months. It finished the day at $592.50 a troy ounce in Zurich, down $40 from yesterday‰ЫЄs close, and fell $31.25 an ounce in London to close at $596.50. In later New York trading, however, gold recovered slightly and some of the dollar‰ЫЄs gains were trimmed."
729492457,6,"INVESTORS spent much of 2004 fretting over rising interest rates, surging oil prices and the presidential election. But those worries turned out to be excessive, Wall Street analysts say.

A postelection rally was buoyed by more stable oil prices and the view that corporate balance sheets look strong."
729492460,7,"Mr. Chakraborrti said he foresaw steady equity gains for 2005, fueled by corporate profits that are finally being translated into corporate activity, rather than into just higher dividend payouts and stock buybacks. He said he expected investors to resume betting on fundamentals."

729492559,5,"The consensus among economists is that inflation stems from excess demand, and for this reason they urge policies to curtail the expansion of the economy. However, there is little evidence to support either the diagnosis or the prescription."
729492560,4,"It is against this background that a small but growing minority of economists have offered a different explanation for inflation. The continual rise in prices, these post-Keynesians argue, stems from conflicts over the distribution of a growing social surplus."
729492561,5,"Post-Keynesians emphasize that the distributional issues can be seen in three dynamic processes that, in conjunction with one another, have led to the unprecedented inflation of the past decade.
