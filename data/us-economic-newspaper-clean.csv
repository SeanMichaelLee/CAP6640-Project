729489549,7,"The upswing in steel profits will derive from a number of factors, the most important of which is that steel consumption will be increasing at an above average rate. Domestic steel consumption, by our estimate, will rise between 5 percent and 6 percent, both this year and next, compared with a compound annual growth rate of 3.4 percent in the past decade. Another constructive factor is the new ceilings on imports, which means that the bulk of the consumption increase should accrue to domestic producers. This means that for the first time in the past decade the steel industryin 1972 and 1973 will be displaying two consecutive years of dynamically increased profits."

""With output apparently already running well above the first-quarter average in April, the odds favor a sigifi-cant acceleration in the G.N.P. growth rate for the second quarter. The predictions of stronger growth for this quarter are based on recent economic data for April, including a 2.1 percent surge in industrial production and a 1.6 percent rise in retail sales.

Settlement Terms Stressed During the strike period, interest rates could fall, he said, but added that the lasting effect of the auto negotiations on interest rates will come from the terms of the settlement.

The last-minute projection that the Federal deficit - would be $225 billion smaller over the next five years than previously estimated smoothed the way to a painless deal on the budget and may have spared the leaders the embarrassment of ideological rebellions among the troops."
729492591,7,"Still, prices largely held on to their gains of the last few days. The price of the 30-year bond settled unchanged yesterday at 921, leaving its yield also unchanged, at 6.57 percent."
729492603,7,"From London to Tokyo, from Toronto to Thailand, markets have opened their doors grudgingly, perhaps, but steadily to foreign money and foreign muscle. Foreign companies sell bonds and stock in the United States, and American firms compete for underwriting business abroad. Foreign currency trading follows the sun, influenced more by time zones than by national borders. Americans open bank accounts denominated in German marks; Asians invest in United States Treasury bills."
729492615,7,"The report sparked a rally in the dollar, which in turn helped push stock and bond prices higher. Administration officials hailed the report, saying their analysis of longterm quarterly averages showed that a favorable movement in the trade balance is under way."
729492637,7,"Meanwhile, the bleak economic atmosphere that dominated the 1982 Congressional elections has disappeared; all indicators are moving in the right direction and the best forecasts though even economists concede that their predictions are written in sand are for a recovery lasting at least until Election Day."

729487666,6,"The rally was led by representative units in the railroads, oils. automotives and televisions. Recuperation was most pronounced in rails and petroleum. The overall comeback was the best since early May."
729487668,6,There was good corporate news to account for the rally in certain divisions. Some items came out in the late hours of trading on Thursday and probably formed the basis for the late recovery then from the lows of the day. Pepsi-Cola benefited both in activity and price appreciation from its first dividend in three years. General Electric's earnings statement was also a bolstering factor.

729487696,6,"In fact, the report, released yesterday by the Citizens Budget Commission, found that Medicaid, not welfare, had been the prime engine of growth in public spending on the poor in the city, particularly in the exploding costs of medical care for the disabled and the elderly poor."

But early this month, when the gold market really took a dive, our business jumped. Volume thus far in July is running 300 percent above the June level. Normally, July and August are dead months in the global bullion market. The certificate buyers, Mr. Volk continued, were equally represented by Citibank's three main groups of precious metals investors its institutional, high net worth and retail customers of more modest means. These three groups, as opposed to the in-and-out gold and silver traders, always take the long-term view, he said."
729487732,6,"Robert S. Boas, president of the board of trustees, explained that the decision reached last May by the 30-member board was strictly a stoiy of economics. It was felt that it would really be cruel to put a show like that, which costs many thousands of dollars, and for what? he said. We'll glitter another time."
729487736,6,The Labor Department said that the August increase in consumer prices was at an annual rate of about 2.4 percent. This falls within the Nixon Administration's goal of reducing the rate of gain to less than 3 percent by the end of this year.

729487841,6,"But there was no sign of such deterioration in figures for December released by the Labor Department Friday. Unemployment was essentially unchanged for the 18th consecutive month and employment showed surprising strength. Indeed, the Commerce Department estimated last week that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2 to 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1979, a surprisingly brisk pace."
729487843,6,Mr. Marshall's forecast was interesting in two ways. It could be considered optimistic. And it is indicative of the difficulty of using the overall national unemployment rate as the principal test of whether the economy is sick enough to Justify antirecession medicine.

729487935,6,"Better Demand Surprising For the second week, improving consumer demand in pre-Easter sales has given department store merchants a pleasant surprise. Dollar sales volume for New York and Brooklyn department | stores for the week ended last Saturday was 1 percent higher than for the corresponding week last year, according to yesterday's flash report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While this sounds small, it was important as the second plus sign to appear in recent months, as well as the second in a row. Retailers last week had only hoped to.come up with a minus 1 percent, or break even. For the four-week period ended last Saturday, volume was 3 percent under that for the comparable 1951 period.

It's still early December and my feeling at this point is that statistically an ease in monetary policy in December can still be made between now and Dec. 19, when the Federal Open Market Committee meets. That is, if we continue to get the same kinds of soft economic data that we have had over that last few months."

While employers actually added 841,000 workers to their payrolls in May, the increase was rather paltry given it is usually the peak time of year for seasonal hiring. After the Labor Department took account of the usual spring hiring surge, the seasonally adjusted gain in payroll employment turned out to be virtually nil a net gain of a mere 11,000 jobs."

729489481,6,"Hardly anyone seems to understand how competition actually works. The standard economic view is that unrestricted competition provides lower prices, higher quality and better services for consumers. The greater the number of sellers competing for the favor of the individual buyer, it is believed, the more that buyer will benefit."

729489528,6,"Government officials, in defending the optimistic economic forecast, observed that private economists have generally underestimated the growth in the economy throughout the post World War II period, and that the Government's higher forecasts have been closer to right. In addition, they pointed out that the private forecasts being made for 1970 have continuously been revised upward."
729489529,6,"One official predicted that private economists would continue to revise upward until they're right throughout the period covered by the budget, which ends in mid-1972. But there were no official estimates of what the unemployment rate would be at any point in the future. It was 6 percent of the work force in December."

One man who has become more positive about steels is Robert A.

729489621,6,"Last month, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers that Inflation might be overstated by as much as 1.5 percentage points In official Government figures. He suggested that a simple fix in the Consumer Price Index could reap big savings. How? Trimming the inflation numbers would mean lower payouts to Social Security beneficiaries, other recipients of Federal benefit programs and retired Government workers."
729489627,6,"But the stock market's outstanding performance reflects more than demographic levitation. It has had an important fundamental support: Corporate earnings have also risen, with a consistency and a magnitude not seen in nearly half a century."
729489632,6,"In his annual economic report to Congress, the Chief Executive made the anti-inflation proposal the cornerstone for economic stability in 1948.

729489678,6,"Although the economy seldom moves in an unbroken trend in any direction, the gyrations this year seem to have been unusually pronounced. And so have the policy actions in Washington. Even so, over time, the economy has managed to trace a steady and strongly upward course throughout the 33 months of the current expansionary phase of the business cycle in this country. Moreover, the conseasus is that the continuing recovery still has considerable life left in it"
729489679,6,"Despite that fact, the stock market has been unwilling to look beyond the valley to the next crest. And businessmen have not been inclined to discount the question marks of the moment to gaze toward a better tomorrow. And yet, when all the pluses and minuses are tabulated, the favorable side of the ledger is definitely longer, and the bottom line shows ai positive balance."
729489680,6,The last few weeks provide a good example of the economy's erratic fluctuations and the nervous state of current thinking in so many quarters. lt should have been a consoling period for analysts of the American business scenewith many more constructive developments than negative onesbut the sense of malaise continued to linger.
729489693,6,"Now the deficit is all but gone, and the tax-cutting wing of the Republican Party is panting at the prospect of big surpluses that could be returned to voters by lowering taxes. But they have already run head-on into another fiscal problem the impending insolvency of the Social Security system and the determined opposition of President Clinton, who views large-scale tax reductions as an excuse to eviscerate needed Government programs; he even sees a risk that the tax cuts would plunge the budget back into deficit."
729489695,6,"To the extent there is a surplus, it enables the Congress to propose all these tax changes, said Gregory F. Jenner, the national director of tax policy at Coopers & Lybrand in Washington. ""Having said that, it's obvious the President has a different agenda. They're going to have to find some common ground."
729489711,6,"The momentum of 1958's advancing stock market was undiminished last week. There was no spectacular rise, but prices rose to record highs in fits and. starts. Apparently, inflation is of concern to the business community."

729489785,6,"Consumer incomes on an annual basis crossed the trillion-dollar mapk in March for the first time, up an enormous $90-biilion, 10 percent, from a year earlier. People clearly have the money to pay the higher prices, and retail sales in the first quarter run about 15 percent ahead of last year."
729489805,6,"Much of the improvement, however, resulted from special one-time factors that significantly bolstered the earnings of several Of the major bank holding companies. Citicorp, the largest with total assets of $121.7 billion, included $36 million in its after-tax earnings that reflected a gain from the sale of real-estate on Lexington Avenue. If this had not been included, its return on each $100 of average total assets would have amounted to 33 cents rather than the 45 cents that it reported."
729489806,6,"The stock market encountered some resistance yesterday in its attempt to return to the high mark set in mid-August, but still closed with an advance. Extreme gains tor the day were shaded in the final hour, when buying diminished and most stocks were left to seek their own levels. At that, the composite rate managed to register a rise of 0.28 point, due the part retention of additions by some of the industrials."
729489811,6,"Financial markets seldom lend themselves to confident short-term prediction, but the current outlook for the credit markets seems even more puzzling than usual. A number of cent weeks and nobody can know which will gain the upper hand to push them strongly one way or the other."
729489812,6,Most analysts still hold to the view that a rapidly expanding economy will eventually produce higher short and longterm interest rate levels during the second half of the year.
729489822,6,"But rapid increases in other construction spending made up for a large part of the decline. Nonresidential construction spending rose at an annual rale of almost 16 percent in the quarter, and local government investment spending principally on things like roads and schools climbed at an annual rale of almost 10 percent."

One tool that savers use to buffer their portfolios is the Series I short for inflation-protected savings bond. But just when it is needed most, the bond's yield has been cut sharply."
729489945,6,"Though the drop may be startling, it is not a big deal if you hold onto the bonds, financial planners say. because the current yield on all I bonds is reset every six months. With those adjustments, the yields should account reasonably well for inflation."
729489947,6,"All three cut their lowest rate on such loans to 8 percent from 7 percent, effective Monday. At 8 percent, the prime rate is at its lowest level since July, 1973, and it is 3% percentage points below its peak of 12 percent, which remained in force all last summer"

The central bank will buy certificates of deposit and certain types of commercial paper from the funds, in hopes of restoring the free flow of credit and easing worries about the investments.

729490040,6,"There is some evidence the Fed's rate increases did their job. Producer prices stayed flat in June, while consumer prices rose an expected three-tenths of 1 percent. On Thursday,1 bond yields fell 14 basis points in the biggest one-day rally in two months."
729490055,6,"Unions also have pressed for protection against future erosion of real earnings. Like many businessmen, labor leaders were not sure whether the upsurge of prices that began in early 1973 was a passing indisposition or the beginning of a prolonged ailment. As it became apparent that the economy was In for an extended siege of inflation, these expectations have been reflected in union demands at the bargaining table."

729490078,6,"This created a final hour volume of more than a million shares and lifted transfers on the Stock Exchange to 3,250,000 for the day, the heaviest in two weeks. This contrasted with Monday's turnover of 1,960,000 shares."

Unless it rallies by the end of next week, Buffalo would seem likely to win the game, since a lower Dow indicates a victory by the team whose name appears first, alphabetically."

729490110,6,"Last week's surge in the stock market, which was accompanied by heavy volume that included a turnover of 21.11-million shares on Thursday, the second busiest day in Big Board history, extended the market's booming pre-election rally through its ninth successive week."

729490141,6,"The stock market continued yesterday to advance despite the threat of a strike against some of the important steel producers. Prices were sustained by a return of public participation and the composite rate showed a gain of 0.44 point. Although the advance was a bit more labored than in earlier sessions this week, the morning provided the only hesi tant period of the day."
729490143,6,"Prices were fractionally reduced at the opening. United States Steel started 2 point lower at 22 on a transfer of 1,500 shares but most other steels were unchanged. Quotations held at the moderately lower level through the rest of the morning and then held steady until the fourth hour, when a spurt in the airline issues gave the list a firmer appearance. The market received its best lift in the final hour when blocks of 50,000 and 10,000 shares of Commonwealth & Southern changed hands."

729490187,6,"The coordinated action, though by no means assured, would most likely involve raising the discount rate, which the Fed charges financial institutions for loans, to 6 percent, from the current 5% percent, and reducing the Bank of Japan's discount rate to 2 percent, from 2 percent. A more modest reduction of a West German interest rate might also be an element, the officials said."
729490190,6,"Some economists said an agreement would be a logical extension of last week's official acknowldege-ments that the Fed has been raising other rates a bit while Japan is reducing its rafes correspondingly. Such an arrangement could imply that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, have not only had enough of the decline in the dollar but are willing to accept some increase in its value."
729490200,6,"""Investing in stocks is tough, but bonds are tougher right now,"" said Lewis Altfest, a financial adviser based in New York who oversees more than $250 million. How tough? Earlier this year, William H. Gross, the Warren E. Buffett of bonds, became so bearish that he pulled some of his personal money from the $75 billion Plmco Total Return bond fund that he runs. He says he is now putting some of that money back in the fund, because prices in the Treasury market have become more reasonable."
729490236,6,"The nation's major corporations experienced a broad but moderate decline in profits during the third quarter, according to earnings reports released thus far. The improvement over the second quarter's results was taken as added evidence of recovery from a sharp but brief recession."
729490257,6,"The Mayor is expected to announce that the city will finish the 1998 fiscal year with,a surplus of $1.2 billion, thanks in large part to a surging Wall Street. It will be the second year in a row of good fortune for the city, which was pummeled by the recession in the early 1990's. The city ended its last fiscal year with $1.4 billion more than it expected."
729490259,6,"The new budget calls for spending on most programs to increase by roughly six-tenths of 1 percent, well under the annual local inflation rate of about 2 to 2.5 percent, administration officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Mayor also plans to call for cuts in some programs, The message of this budget is that we are putting the city on a sound financial course, said a senior administration official. The overall size of the budget, including Federal and state grants, is expected to be $34 billion to $35 billion."
729490260,6,"While the Mayor is proposing that the city reserve most of the surplus to deal with shortfalls in the next two years, some independent fiscal experts say he should use the money for more long-term deficit reduction. In other words, he could allocate the surplus in ways that would spread out the deficit reduction over several years, instead of just the next two. He could do that, for example, by retiring some of the city's growing longterm debt, which would reduce city's payments of principal and interest."
729490271,6,"WASHINGTON, May 19 The economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter this year, slower than originally estimated, the Commerce Department reported today."
729490272,6,"The downward revision from an original estimate of 3.1 percent was a result of a sharper decline in inventories than had been assumed, however, and does not change the outlook for significantly stronger growth this quarter, economists said."
729490273,6,"Several measures of corporate profits released today left a mixed picture of business activity in the quarter. The Commerce Department's preferred measure, profits from current production, jumped 12.4 percent from last year's fourth quarter, after having slipped 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The better-known measure of after-tax profits declined 4.6 percent after falling 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter."
729490275,6,"Except for the deeper decline in inventories, the picture of the first quarter is about the same as originally estimated. About two-thirds of the $9 billion inflation-adjusted rise in the gross national product came from a $6.8 billion gain in housing construction."
729490285,6,"This revision is almost certain to be upward, unless the strong exports are offset by such factors as weaker retail sales or a decline in inventory growth, said Edward E. Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. But I don't really expect any downward revisions in other major factors."

729490296,6,"The stock market, propelled by signs that the economy has picked up steam, moved higher yesterday in accelerated trading."
729490298,6,Analysts said that the upswing was sparked by the report from the Commerce Department at the opening of a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent in the August index of leading economic indicators. The increase was more than Wall Street had expected.
729490307,6,"The list was studded with multi-point gains as numerous stocks broke out of the doldrums, apparently in response to widespread bargain hunting by investors. The Dow-Jones industrial average climbed 14.30 points to close at 933.02."
729490313,6,"We see more and more banks starting to promote loans, said Barry Leeds, whose firm, Barry Leeds & Associates, is a bank market- ing consultancy. They are looking at it as anticyclical and making it part of the ongoing product mix, rather than opening and closing."
729490314,6,"In general, the ability of banks to pay comparable money market rates will increase the supply of funds available to them,"" Paul C. Tongue, senior vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, added. And they will have more money available to make consumer loans. An example of the promotions under way is a recent mailing by Chase enclosing a check-like request certificate offering signature loans of $3,500 to $15,000."
729490340,6,"Management should lessen the impact of new machinery on employment by advising employes of forthcoming changes, cooperating with unions on displacement problems and timing shifts to cushion the expected unemployment through future expansion of the work force in other areas and through normal attrition."
729490350,6,"Historically, he notes, profits have been tied closely to capital outlays. And it has been these expenditures in new plant and equipment plus similar investments in research and development that have provided the chief spur to increased productivity, or output per manhour. And rising productivity has been the primary force offsetting increases in prices."
729490351,6,THE explosive stock market rally of early August went down in the record books both for the volume of business it generated and the speed with which it came and went. But one record it did not chalk up was retail participation.
729490361,6,"WASHINGTON, June 27 The economy grew in the first quarter at a slightly faster pace than previously estimated, and inflation remained in check, the Commerce Department said today."
729490362,6,"Gross domestic product, the nation's output of goods and services excluding foreign income, rose at a 5.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, faster than the 5.8 pace reported earlier. The expansion was the fastest in nearly a decade. The economy grew at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1996."
729490363,6,"Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. The improvement in net exports came as imports turned out to be lower them initially estimated, Mr. Landefeld said. Business inventories grew by $48.6 billion in the quarter, down from the previously estimated $51.4 billion. Real final sales, which exclude the effects of inventory changes, rose 4.1 percent; the rise had been previously put at 3.8 percent."
729490374,6,"House Ways and Means Committee, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, conceded that earlier this year he had miscalculated the strength of the economic recovery and said that the economy now was clearly struggling. But he cautioned the legislators against a quick fix and encouraged them to let the business cycle run its course."
729490407,6,"At the same time, investors would be able to get record yields on the money they lend the cityperhaps as much as 7% percent or more."
729490413,6,The figure suggests that businesses were not stockpiling goods as rapidly as the Commerce Department estimated when it released preliminary figures for second-quarter economic growth last month.
729490429,6,"Investors are not the only ones with big appetites. Mutual fund companies, apparently concerned that 7,000 funds are not enough for the millions of Americans who keep flinging money at the industry, cannot seem to start new funds quickly enough."
729490441,6,The recovery move was not as broad as the decline a day earlier but many leading issue's regained much of the ground they lost in the big sell off a day earlier.
729490442,6,The upswing was helped along by new signs of diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis in the Middle East and by some favorable economic developments on the home front.
729490443,6,The domestic developments included final Congressional approval of a bill to restore the investment tax credit and a Commerce Department report that new factory orders rose in April.
729490444,6,"Market analysts also said that the market was ready for a technical rebound after Wednesday's slide, which, in the opinion of many, put prices into the oversold category."
729490445,6,"In a rare coincidence, the Dow-Jones industrial average rose by the exact amount it lost the day before, closing at $64.9S, up 12.42 points."
729490447,6,Mr. Granville sent the flash a day after a letter had reached all his clients urging them to buy. His change of heart was almost as swift as the one he had at the market low last April when a letter urging all clients to sell arrived while preferred clients were getting a flash telling them to buy.
729490470,6,"By Wednesday, Treasury disbursements had effected a reversal in Treasury deposits with the Federal Reserve, resulting in a $100,000,000 decline from tire statement week."
729490482,6,"In other words, on the basis of the experience of these four years, April, 1958, was out of line by 0.9 percent. And 0.9 percent of the civilian labor force of 68,000,000 comes to 7.5 percent of the civilian labor force, April unemployment stood at a point 2.3 times its most recent (seasonally adjusted) low level of September, 1956, when the corresponding figure was 3.3 percent."
729490496,6,"LONDON, Feb. 4 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Friday that America's record trade deficit might be poised to stabilize and even fall because of market pressures and belt-tightening by the Bush administration."
729490497,6,"Mr. Greenspan was speaking at a gathering coinciding with a scheduled meeting of the finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 7, the leading industrialized nations. His remarks in- spired a strengthening of the dollar, which had fallen because of a weak jobs report in the United States."
729490517,6,"Instead, what they got was a constant succession of rises and declines and all on a minor scale. Prices dipped on Monday, firmed on Tuesday, eased again on Wednesday and moved back up on Thursday. None of the daily changes was large. On Friday after another small advance, The New York Times combined average of fifty stockstwenty-five rails and twenty-five industrialsstood at 403.00, for a net gain for the week of 1.25 points."
729490541,6,Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday for the second consecutive session after another report showing moderate inflation.
729490565,6,"But still, the news on inflation is positive, he added. Based on anything we can clearly see it would be hard to make a 6 percent increase for the year, Mr. Tibbetts said."
729490566,6,Bond prices plunged and yields of short-term debt issues rose sharply yesterday on fears that the nation's basic money supply might expand to the point at which the Federal Reserve would be forced to tighten credit.

729490599,6,"In the last four sessions the Dow has soared 70.87 points, mostly as a result of reductions in the prime rate by a number of banks. Yesterday, two small banks cut the interest rate they charge their most creditworthy corporate customers to 11 % percent from 11% percent. Many observers expect the prime rate to fall soon to 11 percent or lower."
729490617,6,"But in the last few months, borrowers have had a new concern: How to position themselves to get the benefit of a sharp fall in rates between the commitment and closing dates."

729492184,6,"If the Fed continues to ease, as we expect it will, the increased money supply should translate into continued gains in personal income, said Mr. Genetski. The mass of new jobs, although not of the quality of those being lost, should sustain this rise, he added."

While that was considered a sturdy increase, some analysts said they had expected a stronger showing."

729492588,6,"The Fed's decision had little impact on the bond market, as it had long been expected, especially after a surprisingly strong employment report earlier this month crushed any remaining hopes that rates would be lowered yesterday. Indeed, some market participants expect the central bank will refrain from lowering rates at its next policy-making meeting, on May 21, unless it has evidence that the economy is as weak as it appeared at the beginning of the year."

Dow Jones & Company changed the make-up of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average to better reflect the economic importance of services and the entertainment industry. It added the Walt Disney Company, J.P. Morgan & Company and Caterpillar Inc. the most stocks changed since 1959 when four were replaced. It removed the Navistar International Corporation, the Primerica Corporation and the USX Corporation from the list. J.P. Morgan is the first bank to be included in the average. Even with the changes, the Dow still reflects industrial America. Most of stocks are in the manufacturing and resource sectors."

First would be a continued investment participation in smaller and medium-sized companies with the potential of rapid growth. Such commitments as Vctco Offshore, Tropicana Products and Scotty's Home Builders. Secondly, there is ad- ditional emphasis on the consumer sector of the economy. Church's Fried Chicken and Ponderosa Systems fall into this category. Number three would be the increasing interest in the technology area. I think these are excellent cyclical plays. Purchases included National Semiconductor, Data General and Hewlett Packard."

729488002,5,"Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed largely missed the problem, cutting interest rates aggressively to stimulate more lending only after the economy began to contract. And as he confronts another credit shortage that could put the nation's long business expansion at risk, Mr. Greenspan is determined not to make the same mistake again, as evidenced by his unusual decision on Thursday to cut rates by a quarter percentage point between the central bank's regularly scheduled policy meetings. Economists now expect a series Virtually the only blemish on Mr. Greenspan's record as chairman was in not acting forcefully enough to offset the 1989-1990 credit crunch, which was the fundamental cause of the 1990 recession, said G.

Added to their portfolio were $7,000,000 in United States bonds callable or maturing within one year and $129,000,000 in the one-to-five-year group. The latter bulge was due primarily to a reclassification as to maturities. Bonds maturing in more than five years showed a decrease of $72,000,000 and all other holdings increased $21,000,000."

Maybe the annual inflation rate can get as high as 4 percent it is 2.8 percent today and still not shoot up, as it did in the 70's. They are manufacturers, retailers and some bankers, among others. All are prospering. And they argue that their newfound prosperity might not last without a little tolerance of rising Inflation."

729488183,5,"The figure is part of a general tabulation that reveals a paradox of the current recession. That is, by far the Government's most important weapon against the recession, outside of defense spending, has been the Social Security reforms enacted in the New Deal years, together with subsequent improvements, and not the actions specifically undertaken to combat the recession."

Pressing the analogy between inflation and the behavior of crowds, Professor Nordhaus said that you could make the game so boring that people would sit down again; in economics, this means inducing recession or depression by more restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. Or you could try to coax people into sitting down, the way a quarterback calls for a hush before he will call signals again; the economic equivalent is jawboning by the President or his aides. The third alternative equivalent to throwing people out of the football stadium is coercion by direct wage and price controls."
729488551,5,"Bankers say the widening spread, visible in earnings reports filed in recent days, is needed so they can earn more on their good consumer and busi- ness loans to compensate for losses from rising defaults and delinquencies on such loans.

729488554,5,"Mr. Bryan noted that early in the 1980's and before, when banks did not have such large loan losses, interest rates on loans tended to match more closely interest rates set in financial markets.

Mr. Shiskin, who noted that the May unemployment rate was 9.2 percent, said the June distortion would reflect faulty seasonal adjustment. We're locked into a seasonal adjustment rate announced earlier this year, he said.

The objective would be to improve monetary control through the discipline of gold for the purpose of reducing inflation. Linking changes in the growth rate of money or of some component of money, such as Federal Reserve notes, or of bank reserves, to the change in the gold stock is one approach which was considered for imposing the discipline of gold."

He continued: ""While these added expenses are unfortunate because of the sacrifices involved as well as the necessary postponement of tax cuts and more desirable Government spending, present plans for additional military spending do not require a basic shift in policy."

Growth in the current quarter appears robust. Fears of a credit squeeze in the bond market have abated.

In addition, savers have been told by most financial advisers for years that they need 70 percent better yet, 80 percent of their preretirement income to retire comfortably. These figures usually come from mutual fund companies or stockbrokers. Charles R.

In 1982, money began flowing more readily to the long-term bond market once short-term interest rates declined to levels that were less than the yields on long-term bonds. That is in contrast with 1981 and early 1982, when yields on shortterm securities were higher than on long-term bonds a condition which detered investment in long-term bonds and drew billions of dollars to the money market funds."
729490949,5,"Besides offering yields that are often higher than those of short-term issues, investments in bonds have traditionally attracted those who want to be certain of receiving income for years into the future. Such certainty is not possible with common stocks, whose dividends may be cut or elimlanted, or with money market funds, whose yields can fluctuate widely."

In assuring the auto industry and auto union leaders that help would be forthcoming, was the President sounding retreat along a broad front? In his talk to the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks, in which he said he was looking forward to the end of credit controls, was the Fed chairman, Paul A.

But even in this respect, a trading range of 4 points over the past month offers little basis for operations."
729491849,5,"While the job situation showed no dramatic developments last month, today's statistics did include one item of possible significance. The near-explosion of wages in the two months following the end of controls April 30 gave way to a much more moderate increase in July."
729491851,5,"Not only was over-all unemployment little changed last month, but the same was also true for most of the various categories of the labor force, such as married men, adult women, teen-agers and the like."
729491854,5,"The Labor Department's monthly employment report appeared to provide political talking points both for President Ford, who can point to a solid expansion of job holding, and for his opponents, Republican and Democratic, who can underline the continuing ravages of the recession for those who are still out of work."
729491870,5,"For investors, the theoretical advantage is that yields rise if interest rates generally do, and without the penalty of the bond's price falling as would be true in a regular issue. For the issuers, the lure is that interest costs can be reduced if rates decline and the consensus on Wall Street last spring was that interest rates were very close to their peaks."
729491872,5,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 For nearly two decades, rapid economic recoveries generated higher inflation. But Government figures on growth and inflation in recent days confirm that the nation's economy has passed through the fast-growth phase of another strong recovery, and this time inflation barely budged."

729491918,5,Yet the old advice to begin saving early and regularly for retirement has more validity than ever. That is because the more time your money has to work for you especially if it is invested in a way that lets your interest Income accumulate tax-free the more you will have available at retirement.
729491928,7,"The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 40.04 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,244.93. The broader gauges were also higher.

The Nasdaq composite index gained 13.11 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,921.18, its best finish in two months."
729491963,5,"It is still too early for any let-up in the Government's anti-inflation campaign, despite evidence that the economy has begun to slow and the contention in some quarters that a recession is already assured."
729491965,5,"Mr. Walker took special pains to explain why, in his view, there still remained widespread skepticism about the ability or the will of the authorities to persevere until inflation and the expectation of inflation were curbed. For one thing, he noted, many have misinterpreted a policy of gradual restraint for one that was flabby. In actuality, he added, the policy was one of firmness that was not designed either to permit a high rate of inflation or to throw the economy into a tailspin."
729491966,5,"The fact that the Administration had decided not to invoke controls on wages, prices or credit should not be construed as a sign of weakness,"
729491993,5,"The bond market's action was based purely on the assumption the Nixon telecast at 7:50 o'clock tonight would disclose strong steps to curb inflation, dealers said. If Phase Two turned out to be less powerful than the bond market now generally supposes, the advance could end quickly tomorrow. some warned."
729491994,5,"Corporate bond prices, which frequently were down an eighth or a quarter of a point early yesterday, recovered beginning about 1:31 P.M. Many recently offered corporate bonds closed a quarter to three-quarters of a point above Tuesday's closing levels."
729492003,5,"While some economists are expecting growth this year to be as much as 4 percent, up from 2.8 percent last year, other analysts note that evidence so far this year shows inflation is still subdued. Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month and 2.5 percent for the 12 months that ended in March, below last year's increase of 2.7 percent. Producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in the same period, and at a similar pace in 1993."
729492029,5,"Extractive industries such as oil and gas remain depressed, though the number of oil rigs operating in Wyoming is up to 54, an increase of 20 over a year ago. But there aren't any real bright spots here, says Gordon Wolford, a state statistical analyst. There's virtually no residential construction, and statewide real-estate prices are down about 30 percent. The exception is Teton County in northwest Wyoming, where Grand Teton National Park and part of Yellowstone National Park are situated. Tourism has remained strong in Jackson Hole, as has the housing market, Mr. Wolford said."
729492034,5,"Bond men said that the market was indifferent, too, to the implications of the Administration's request for a temporary increase in the statutory debt limit. The professionals were expecting a move of this kind. It is felt that the discount rate rise, an adjustment in basic costs that had been lagging behind the market's other basic market costs, is part of the official grooming of the market for cash borrowing by the Treasury in July and August."
729492038,5,"In the dally How ol economic data, that was the latest headline, and it sent stock prices smartly higher for a while. A second report new orders last month for computers, machinery, trucks, planes and other durable goods was also positive. But it failed to provide convincing evidence that companies were once again expanding. Without that turnaround in capital spending, the consumer-led recovery could lose steam."
729492042,5,"The Federal Reserve has made bank reserves more plentiful in the banking system, leaving analysts to debate whether the extra funds are an early sign of a slight easing of monetary policy or merely intended to assure the money markets that the financial difficulties of Drysdale Government Securities would not spread to other firms."
729492049,5,"Of course. Dr, Burns does not run the nation's monetary policy alone. There are six other members of the Reserve Board and, in addition, five presidents of Federal Reserve banks who vote on the key Open Market Committee."
729492085,5,The two changes are not directly related and are aimed at dealing with separate problems. The Reserve proposed that the changes take effect simultaneously because of their roughly offsetting effects on bank reserves and to avoid complications for monetary policy that could arise from the adoption of either proposal separately. The announcement said that the proposals are intended to be neutral with respect to monetary policy.
729492088,5,"Trading in IBM opened yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at 11:20 A.M. The ticker tape showed that a block of S5.000 shares was sold at 8388 a share, followed by another 1,000 shares at the same price."

729492156,5,"Against that background, the notion that we might comfortably live with inflation or that we could accept inflation in the interest of strong growth was exposed as an Illusion. I believe it is fair to say a clear national consensus emerged that turning back inflation had to be a top priority of economic policy that a stable dollar is a necessary part of the foundation of a strong economy."
729492177,5,"The stock market rode out the busiest day In its 204-year history yesterday, and the wildest day since the 1987 market plunge, to end basically unchanged."
729492181,5,"Mutual fund companies began to report a modest level of redemptions as small investors began to leave the market. As buyers and sellers flooded the markets with orders, volume records were broken on the New York Stock Exchange, where a historic 683 million shares changed hands, and on the Nasdaq market, where a record 877 million shares were traded. This frenzy was a reflection of genuine confusion in the marketplace as investors wondered where stocks would head next."

729492236,5,"While the housing sector has been slumping, the decline in construction of new homes and sales of homes stems from the rising interest rates that preceded the stock market's collapse, and much of those increases have been reversed."
729492242,5,"Two months ago, when the Federal Reserve imposed controls on consumer credit as an anti-inflation measure, economists generally brushed off these i restrictions as largely symbolic. The controls, they predicted, would be too limited in scope to have any real bite."
729492243,5,"But as things turned out, the credit controls have had a substantial impact. According to economists, the credit measures, which made it somewhat more costly to extend or receive credit, have I prompted millions of Americans to alter their spending and credit habits. The Federal Reserve program appears to have moved consumers to use their credit cards and charge accounts much less, and it has thereby shaken the buy-now pay-later philosophy that until recently has kept inflation going."
729492244,5,"It may have been symbolic, but it was shocking,'' S. Lees Booth, senior vice president and economist for the National Consumer Finance Association, a Washington-based trade group for finance companies, said of the Federal Reserve initiative.

729492278,5,"The reaction of the market to the death knell for the tax reduction bill, as the House upheld ths White House veto, was negligible, and a repetition of the inaction on Monday when President Truman vetoed the legislation."
729492279,5,"The action of the market so far this week would seem to indicate that tax reduction prospects played a minor role and that the principal concern of the investor remains the issue of recession. Of probable concern, however, is the fate of the labor regulation bill, particularly since this legislation bears directly on industrial stability. In this regard, a Presidential veto appears to most brokers to have been discounted."

729492292,5,By DAVID W. CHEN New York City officials say that their projected share of federal funds for low-income housing vouchers is more than $61 million short of what is needed because the federal government underestimated the inflation rate and the cost of living in the city.
729492295,5,"Similar problems have occurred in other cities with housing costs rising faster than the national average. In all, 492 out of an estimated 2,500 housing agencies that issue vouchers have asked for more money, said Donna White, a spokeswoman for the federal housing department. Ms. White said she could not discuss the city's chances for an appeal."
729492297,5,"Judging by the stock market, at least, the psychological effect of the steel strike on the business community seemed to be rather minorat least for the time being. True enough, stocks sold off somewhat right after the long-expected walkout be gan. But this was widely attributed to a consolidation of previous gains and other technical factors."

Although unemployment rates have not reached Depression levels or even those of the 1982 recession, today's unemployed are a different breed. They include the labor elite in manufacturing as well as an increasing proportion of white-collar workers. Jobs can still be found in unskilled trades, but they are disappearing in highly paid occupations. The foundation of American prosperity the belief that hard-working, educated men and women can count on lifetime employment and a rising standard of living for themselves and their children is now being eroded."

The problem is caused by living beyond our means as individuals and as a nation. Private citizens and Washington bureaucrats spend too much money and save too little. There are not enough domestic savings to finance new investment that would, in turn, increase productivity.

When the economy is booming, the Fed is very good at slowing it down reducing inflation but also making it harder for people to buy homes, keep jobs and purchase cars. Then, a funny thing happens once the economy slows: The Fed gets reluctant to bring back prosperity."
729489026,4,"That reluctance is very much in evidence now. Until February, the economy was robust. The Fed's response, given its visceral hatred of inflation, was to slow it down by doubling interest rates in the space of a year. The slowdown came, and the urgency to act disappeared, although by law the Fed is supposed to be as quick to maintain jobs as to control inflation."
729489028,4,"The details are different, then and now. The inflation rate was higher in 1989, for example, than it is today. Real estate was more of a drag on the economy, junk bonds were a problem, and wages seemed more likely to rise, contributing to inflation. But by all accounts, the dialogue and the dynamics of dealing with a slowing economy are strikingly similar. And seven of the 1989 policymakers are still there, starting with Alan Greenspan, the chairman."

The last meeting had taken place only two weeks earlier and at the meeting just before that one, on March 28, Mr. Greenspan had declared: The odds in my judgment are somewhat 50-50 that we will have to tighten raise rates again before this cycle is over."" Instead, just two months later on June 5, Mr. Greenspan ordered the first cut in rates. It was just a quarter-point decline, and he and his colleagues kept lowering rates bit by bit for the next three yeats. But the economy, instead of reviving as loans became cheaper, fell into recession in July 1990. And the Fed never achieved its ideal, which it calls a soft landing,"" a state of being in which the economy grows by just enough to keep the unemployment rate and the inflation rate steady at fairly low levels."

729489068,4,"There are other aspects of the mortgage scene, however, that remain unchanged.

729489091,4,"According to productivity experts, inflation may discourage long-term investment and that, is precisely the sort of capital spending that is needed to enhance productivity research and improved technology."
729489093,4,"The higher the rate of inflation, the higher the rate of insecurity, says George Kuper. executive director of the Center for Productivity and Quality of Work Life, a Federal agency.

729491140,4,"If the central bank raised rates again and the economy slowed sharply, Mr. Greenspan said, it could easily lower rates and the economy would bounce back quickly. But if the Federal Reserve failed to raise rates high enough, he said, inflation could return and could be beaten back only at the cost of a prolonged economic slowdown."
729491141,4,"His comments today prompted traders and investors to sell securities now because another interest rate increase might force prices lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.04 points, to 3,727.27, while the Interest rate on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.54 percent, from 7.46 percent on Tuesday."
729491144,4,President Bush repeatedly called on the parties to bridge their differences and act but offered no new proposals of his own and defended his focus on tax cuts.

729491163,4,"Over-all, stock prices continued their recent behavior of indecision amidst conflicting economic forces. For example, the Dow Jones industrial average displayed a token change for the sixth straight trading day as it edged up 0.86 point to 792.50."
729491165,4,"In the current atmosphere of investor apathy, volume on the New York Stock Exchange held to a slow pace of 9.06 million shares, off a shade from Wednesday's 9.07 million shares and well below this year's average turnover of 10.6 million shares."
729491167,4,"Interest in the stock market lagged yesterday and the tape showed it. It was the narrowest session since October and the slowest since August. Volume fell to 920,000 shares. In fact, in one hour between 2 P.M. and 3 P. M. only 100,000 shares changed hands."
729491182,4,"Dspite steady growth and low inflation, polls show that voters, especially the middle class, are unhappy and may not reward the Democrats. Have they forgotten economic growth? No, but higher interest rates have spoiled the benefits of growth for many Americans."
729491186,4,"Since then, the White House has been trapped. It predicted that higher short rates would bring long rates down. It turned out to be wrong. Now it claims that long-term interest rates will remain high because of demands for capital, even though total credit is up only 5 percent this year. The markets are not fooled."
729491189,4,"One such factor was a decline in the Federal funds rate, to 8 percent for most of the day, from 8.63 percent on Monday. Federal funds are overnight balances that banks buy and sell among themselves. It is the rate most directly affected by the actions of the Federal Reserve."
729491192,4,"WASHINGTON, May 29-Senator William J. Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas, warned, last night there was heavy speculation in the stock market and said stock margin means the down payment on the price of the stock. One hundred percent margin would require full payment, and would thus bar securities purchases on credit."
729491196,4,Mr. Fulbright said a substantial degree of stock speculation was indicated by increases in brokers' loans and short-term trading.
729491203,4,Many analyts expect a weak employment report to be the catalyst for another move by the Federal Reserve to push short-term rates lower.

729491207,4,A feeble stock-market rally yesterday morning gave way to afternoon selling pressure that produced a mild setback.
729491208,4,"The Dow-Jones industrial average stood 4.14 points higher at 10:30 A.M., but lost ground steadily in the half-hourly readings to finish at 891.16 with a loss of 3.68 points."
729491209,4,The bulk of this decline occurred in the final 30 minutes of trading to place the blue-chip average at a new 1969 closing low.
729491210,4,"Groups showing strength in the morning included the oil, airline, motor and computer issues. Shortly before noon, advances outnumbered declines by a ratio of better than 7-to-5 on the New York Stock Exchange."
729491221,4,"The government reported yesterday that the core rate of inflation, which excludes energy and food, rose -by a tame 02 percent in January, in line with economists' forecasts. Higher prices for gasoline and electricity sent the broader Consumer Price Index up 0.7 percent last month, a greater increase than economists expected and the largest rise in prices in four months."
729491223,4,"Mr. Peterson, who is president of the Chicago Mortgage Investment Company, urged that this country abandon the economic concepts that had guided the procedures and practices in the Federal mortgage credit system during the last twenty-five years. He referred to these concepts as false premises that have misled us. In their stead he offered a program that would, in his opinion, adjust demand to available funds, assure an equal distribution of credit among all users, and meet the nation's housing needs in the years-ahead."
729491236,4,"Instead of trying to probe fori new price levels yesterday afternoon, they said they would have to wait to see what pressures developed in the credit markets today. If commercial banks raise their prime rates to 6 percent is widely expected prices of most fixed, income securities will decline further today, dealers predicted late yesterday."
729491244,4,"Mr. Volcker outlined his monetary targets for the rest of this year and next as he presented the Fed's midyear review of policy to the Senate Banking Committee. Although shortterm interest rates have declined in the last two weeks, analysts did not interpret the Fed's announcement, especially the higher-than-expected tentative target for 1983, as a major change in the Fed's overall tough antiinflation policy."
729491246,4,"For 1983, the Fed's decision against cutting the target range, according to earlier interviews with Fed governors, showed the central bank's wish not to get locked into a policy that was too tight to accommodate a recovery next year. This means the target range tor M-1 will stay at 2 percent to 5 percent, instead of being reduced by half a percentage point beginning Jan. 1, as was the Fed's policy for the last two years."
729491259,4,"For the country as a whole, household savings have long been greater than debts, even including home mortgages, and households have traditionally earned more interest than they pay. Since the late 1970's, when controls on interest rates were removed from bank deposits, the gap between interest receipts and interest payments has widened. By the first quarter of this year, households earned $680 billion of interest but paid only $320 billion."
729491260,4,"The gap means that when rates fall, the decline in income is greater than the decline in savings. What's more, the discomfort from lower rates is heightened because interest rates on savings are quicker to decline than on home mortgages, credit cards and other kinds of consumer debt."
729491264,4,"William McChesney Martin Jr., a market-minded man with no pretensions to intellectual innovation but with an unparalleled ability to win respect and'cooperation, is stepping down when the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy is under severe challenge."
729491270,4,"The basic signals had gone out on Tuesday. Up more than 25 points at the opening bell in reaction to Monday night's news that Richard 'M. Nixon had published a new set of highly damaging tapes, the Dow then backed off nervously, though slightly, as a mysterious cabinet meeting was announced in late morning,"

729491323,4,"Commissioner Joseph P. Mc-Murray said the indicated total of 80,000 homes constructed or authorized in the state during 1956 would be the lowest since 100,000. A spurt in multi-family residential building in Westchester County and of one-family homes in Rockland County was contrary to the continuing downward trend in other areas of the state, he said."
729491324,4,"It is pleasant to enjoy the fruits of our financial prosperity, he remarked but we would be economic idiots if we were not to look to the past and see what the destruction of so important a segment of our economic life can have on the rest of the economy. It is highly probable that any economic shock the home building industry suffers would be transmitted cumulatively to the rest of the economy. Early in December the Federal Housing Administration allowed an increase of one half of 1 percent to 5 percent in the interest rate on mortgages that it insured. However, I mortgages guaranteed by the Veterans Administration continue to carry a 4.2 percent interest, and only Congress can change that rate. Meanwhile, conventional, or private mortgages are being made at 5 to 6 percent in most parts of the country."
729491335,4,"Mr. Glass said that yesterday's trading included a fair amount of short-covering, which is the purchase of dollars to cover agreements to sell dollars."
729491345,4,"Herbert Stein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, emphasized this change in a statement that he made today. He said that the small increase in the number of available jobs in May constituted another piece of ce that the growth in onomy has at least subsided from the un-nable and highly inflation ate of previous months."
729491351,4,"Late last week, Donald T. Regan, its board chairman, disclosed what Merrill Lynch would do. It elected to cut rates on orders of $2,000 or less by 16 to 25 percent. If it has any increases in prospect, they have not yet emerged."
729491352,4,"Interest rates rose modestly yesterday in quiet trading, as major investors remained on the sidelines and traders were cautious in the face of rising short-term rates."
729491354,4,"The lack of conviction stems from the ambiguous nature of recent economic data, which show that economic growth is slowing, but not necessarily enough to bring about lower interest rates."
729491355,4,"It would be a mistake to assume that overall business credit demands are on the wane just because the economy is less robust than earlier in the year, said Abraham Gulkowitz, vice president at the Bankers Trust Company. In the latest Issue of Prospects for the Credit Markets, Mr. Gulkowitz said business credit demands should continue to expand, particularly in the commercial paper market, while consumers are still in good financial condition."
729491360,4,"Will the strategy work? Nobody can be sure. Some auto officials wonder if the new models will sell any better than the present cars, which are already jamming manufacturers' and dealers' storage lots. The cars on hand add up to nearly a 3 month supply."
729491365,4,"The general view remained, however, that while the gross national product would contract during the current quarter, the decline would be less than the 2 to 4 percent that probably occurred in the fourth quarter. If so, this would support the Bush Administration and others in their contention that the worst of the recession is already past, but today's figures did seem to reduce the prospects that a turnaround would come soon. The report on the fourth-quarter G.N.P. is due Jan. 25."
729491370,4,"As yields on Treasury bills have fallen to just above 7 percent, investors have moved out to longer-term maturities, thus causing higher prices and lower yields for those issues as well. Yesterday, for example, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell below 10 percent for the first time since 1980."
729491374,4,"Retail sales fell six-tenths of 1 percent in April, the first decline in six months. But the report was considered misleading because cool weather held down buying and an early Easter put most holiday shopping in March. Bearing out that theory was a revision of the March sales gain to 1.7 percent, up from eight-tenths of 1 percent. Business sales in March gained 1.9 percent, the biggest rise in more than a year. Business inventories were up three-tenths of 1 percent, the smallest rise in seven months."
729491376,4,"The Treasury auctions ended, and the worst fears of the markets were not realized. The Japanese were active buyers and demand was strong enough that yields were easing by week's end. Still, yields on the 3-year and 10-year notes had to rise to levels not seen since 1985 to attract buyers. The yield on 30-year bonds peaked at"

It doesn't seem to have turned out that way; Americans have turned away from collecting art as if bored. But a couple of current print exhibitions reveal that for their part, print publishers and printmak-ers have been working to accommodate the taste nurtured in the 1980's for large-scale works and bold imagery."
729491389,4,"Sharp variations in monetary conditions have high and frequently underestimated costs. If our economic stabilization objectives could be achieved with more stable monetary conditions in the future, we would all be better off."
729491417,4,"THE question on everyone's lips now is whether the hard-hit stock market go lower still. Unfortunately, pundits to the contrary notwithstanding, the answer is that no one knows."
729491418,4,"Judged by the magnitude of losses in the bear market of the last three and a half months, a turnaround could be imminent. An abrupt about-face yesterday that saw a slide of more than 14 points in the Dow Jones industrials replaced by an 18.55 point gain by the market's close was encouraging. The Dow closed at 842.56."
729491438,4,"Productivity gains are necessary, also, if the nation is to cover the costs of cleaning up the environment and restoring its cities and if it is to satisfy the income aspirations of its people, particularly blacks and others heretofore deprived."
729491439,4,"The unfortunate fact is that productivity gains have been slowing down in recent years. At the same time, the countries of Western Europe and Japan have been making more rapid gains."
729491449,4,"Then there was the news that food prices dropped 17 percent in the last three months. Indeed they have, at the wholesale level. But at the supermarkets, the price continued to rise arousing warnings from President Carter that retailers should re-examine their pricing policies. He cited an extraordinary increase in the spread between farm and store prices 109 percent for meat, for example."

729491517,4,"SINCE mid-July, when stock .market averages began drooping, investors have been worriedly watching and wondering what the professionals think about the major markets. Then came Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Now, the questions for institutional portfolio managers, the driving force behind the markets in this country, are obviously much more urgent."
729491521,4,"Mr. Jordan: This has to be a buying opportunity. Markets make bottoms on bad news and people who buy stocks on good news are late. Even if we are going into a depression, we have to rally first. The market is already discounting a doubling of the price of oil, war, a recession and higher interest rates. The risk has been taken out of the stock market. What most people don't understand is that psychology plays such an important part. There is widespread fear, and I suspect it is going to increase over the next couple of weeks."
729491524,4,"The most dramatic decline was registered in the price of the Treasury's bellwether 8.75 percent, 30-year bond. By late in the day, the 30-year issue was down by more than 3 points, or more than $30 for each $1,000 face value of securities, to an offer of 98, to yield 8.93 percent."

729491601,4,"Meanwhile, the credit market received two additional stimulants yesterday. One was the report that housing starts in November dropped 12.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis. Many economists had expected that at worst there would be no change from October. As interpreted by the credit market, it means reduced demand for mortgage money, a factor that usually influences the over all interest rates."
729491602,4,"WASHINGTON, March 27 ,The unemployment figures for March have been gathered in the outlying precincts. They will be computed and published in a week or two. If they show another increase, political pressures for more economic stimulants will rise, too, for serious unemployment is bad politics."
729491606,4,"An unemployment rate of 3 to 4 percent allowing for seasonal variations has, for many years, been thought to approximate a normal frictional ratethat is, the rate which could be accounted for by job turnover and the more or less accidental factors of personal adjustment in the labor market."

729491623,4,"While reports from various cities differed, the public generally seemed slow to buy. Many business men predicted an upsurge in sales as soon as the new situation takes hold, but their optimism was not shared by Federal economists in Washington. The latter forecast ""little effect, according to the United Press."
729491641,4,"This will be the first time since the early 1990s that workers are exhausting benefits that have been extended twice because of an economic downturn.

729491644,4,"And a top economist at a major New York bank said: Unless the Fed gets help from other quarters, what the Fed does will be of very little consequence in fighting inflation."
729491646,4,"All you can say is that every little bit helps; it's an incremental effort, said Henry Wallich, a Federal Reserve Board Governor. I wouldn't say that monetary policy by itself will stop inflation in a very short period of time. It needs to be done in combination with fiscal policy and with restraint on Government actions that raise costs and prices."

729491688,4,"Mr. Volcker was unhappy with a statement last week by Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who said that because of flagging productivity growth, the underlying or basic rate of inflation was now 8 to 9 percent and was not likely to go back to 6 or 7 percent. Today, in an interview on ABC's ""Issues and Answers,"" Mr. Volcker said that I am not one of those who thinks we can live with a high rate of inflation, because I think it is inherently tin unstable condition. He added: If you get used to an 8 or 9 percent inflation rate, the tendency is to speed above that, and then expectations begin running ahead of the actual price level. ""What we have to work toward over a period of time is getting back to a noninflationary situation, and that is what we intend to do."" he said."
729491698,4,"Although the increase in the jobless rate was just one-tenth of a percentage point, there have not been three consecutive monthly advances since the 1981-1982 recession, and analysts expressed general agreement that today's report, the first comprehensive gauge of economic performance last month, had many earmarks of a recession."
729491699,4,"We're probably now in one,"" commented David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities International in New York. ""There is absolutely no area to be optimistic about. Jobs in manufacturing, for example, tumbled by a further 66,000 in September, the second biggest loss since factory employment began to fall in early 1989. A total of 520,000 such jobs have disappeared since then, 115.000 of them in the last two months."
729491700,4,"Even more disheartening, analysts said, is the fact that in recent months employment in the much larger service sector, which had previously more than offset declines in factory and other goods-producing jobs, has stopped rising."
729491701,4,"This, warned the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Dr. Janet L. Norwood, requires close scrutiny. She told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress today that even if the economy was not yet in recession there's great risk, very clearly"" of such a downturn. Afterward she characterized the labor market as crummy."

729491713,4,"In what has been a grueling summer for the stock market, shares sank further yesterday. But many investors remained calm and held their ground, resigned to the possibility that the market had yet to reach a bottom."
729491714,4,"We're almost back to Sept. 11 in our fear, said Dolores Fanton, 50, who lives in Victor, N.Y. The doom and gloom on the news is enough to scare anybody."
729491719,4,"The bonds' appeal resides in one significant feature. Unlike regular bonds, TIPS have interest rates with two effective components: one fixed, the other tied to inflation, as measured twice a year by the Consumer Price Index. If inflation rises as it did in March, with an unexpectedly big price jump of 0.5 percent so, eventually, does the bond's yield and principal. But if inflation declines, then the yield and principal value of the bond also falls, though an investor will recoup no less than the par principal amount at maturity."

729487844,3,"The reason the Labor Secretary's projection seemed deliberately optimistic is that, as he knows, President Carter's economic forecasters put the jobless rate at around 7.5 percent by Election Day. Furthermore, the unemployment rate is notoriously volatile. It could easily jump to 0.5 percent as early as March and go on climbing. As the Citibank economics staff has observed, ""Typically, unemployment rises rapidly in the early stages of a recession."

Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in his book, Presidential Economics. to abandon his stance against tax increases. But if so, it may have been a passing impulse.

But prices have risen just as much in the six months since August, about when the recession began, as in the six months before. Some economists say that slack commodity and labor costs and unused capacity at factories will keep inflation in check. As Samuel D.

As a result, the purchasing power of the average worker's weekly take-home pay dipped by 4.6 percent in the last 12 months."
729490058,3,"For example, growth in output per hour of work in the private business sector of our economy averaged 3.3 percent a year from 1948 to 1966. but only 2.1 percent a year from 1966 to the business cycle peak in 1973 (productivity always slows down during recessions). If we indude nonprofit organizations and Government as well as private employers, the deterioration appears to be even more dramatic."

729490076,3,"A thirty-minute selling attack on the final hour, unmatched in intensity since the collapse immediately after the entrance of the United States into the Korean situation, struck the stock market yesterday. Prices quickly melted 1 to 4 points in the leading industrial issues and, although some of the wounds were dressed before the close, quotations ended at about the worst of the session."

The Dow Jones rails eased 0.97, to 205.29, the lowest closing level for that indicator since Jan. 4, 543.27, and ran up a May deficit of 6.79.

729490086,3,The barrage of corporate takeovers in 1985 enriched stockholders of the acquired companies and helped the stock market climb to a record. But there is growing evidence that shareholders of the surviving companies are no better off and that bondholders on both sides are often big losers.

That contrasts with 1989, when there was an increase of 5,900 jobs. In 1988 the Island gained 13,900 jobs. The peak year was 1984, with an increase of 51,900."

The Fed cannot lower interest rates because of eye-popping economic strength, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis."
729490237,3,Analysts generally say they expect earnings to drop again in the fourth quarter and possibly in the first three months of 1981. But they also say the size of the declines is likely to be less than they had forecast a month or two ago.

Murphy of the General Motors Corporation; have pledged to support the President's anti-inflation program, even if it means an economic slowdown and lower profits.

Nonetheless, it is an innovation not tried in this precise form in any other country and nearly all indus-News trial countries"
729490372,3,"But the Fed's steady decrease in interest rates since 1989 seems to have been inadequate. And recently, within the central bank and among economists across most of the ideological spectrum, the sense has been growing that President Bush and the Democrats who control Congress would try to fight the recession next year with a pre-election bidding war over tax giveaways."

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the April consumer price index set another record123.5 percent of the 1947-49 average, compared with 123.3 for March.

729490420,3,5.8 percent level of pay settlements negotiated last year. That may sound surprising since Government statistics show that the average wage-earner has been losing the race with inflation in the last year. What the worker could buy with his weekly take-home pay after allowing for higher prices and taxes left him 3 percent worse off than he had been at the start of 1973. There is no expectation in labor circles that inflation will climb at less than the 8.8 percent clip of last year. The much more prevalent view is thatconsumer prices will shoot up by 10 percent or more this year. Why then is there still no audible clamor for a return to ever-larger pay increases?

729490454,3,"The yield curve inverted two months before the 1973-75 recession began. In the fourth quarter of 1978 and in the fourth quarter of 1980, the yield curve inverted, recovered and inverted again, correctly predicting the double-dip recessions of 1980 and 1981-82, which some economists see as one recession."
729490455,3,"How about the latest recession, which may or may not be over? The Administration attributed the onset of the recession to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf crisis in August 1990.

In addition to larger reductions in manufacturing, there has been significant easing in some non-manufacturing lines in which employment held up in the earlier recessions. workers have declined despite further advances in wage rates. The average work week has been shortened, overtime work ;at premium rates has been eliminated or sharply curtailed, and the number of workers on part time has greatly increased. Moreover, the purchasing power of all incomes, including wages and salaries, has been further reduced by continued increases in consumer prices."
729490485,3,"The sharp rise in unemployment for men 20 to 24 years of age may have been a factor in the decline in the marriage rate that began last autumn. The unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent in April in the construction, mining and manufacturing industries. It has risen from 5 to 11 percent in manufacturing and from 5 to 13 percent in mining since last year. One in six construction workers was unemployed in April, 1958. This was the highest unemployment rate for any major industry but the increase from a year earlier was less than that in many other industries. Unemployment rates among service and government workers have been relatively low."

That's about the same as the one-year bill. If rates remain stable or lower, the 30-year bond would provide returns so much better that he recommends it over the shorter issues. As of yesterday, the five-year yielded 4.6 percent, the 30-year 5.9 percent. Most mainstream domestic debt offers yields and potential price gains far below the returns of recent years, Mr. Beckwitt says. He has turned instead to foreign debt, junk bonds and some stocks. He likes emerging markets, especially Mexico, an investment grade country, but it's not rated that way,'' he said.

729492044,3,"The Fed's general policy shift over the past two or three weeks has been toward an easing in bank reserve pressures, economists at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company said in a market commentary dated May 24. Slower growth in basic money supply in May, and the prospect for slow growth in June, should lead the Fed to provide enough reserves to result in a rate of 12 percent to 13.4 percent for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market, they said, down from 14.67 percent and 14.97 percent in the weeks ended May 19 and May 12."

Efforts to negotiate a compromise in the Senate have been faltering, all but ending hopes expressed by both sides of getting a bill signed into law quickly at a time when layoffs are mounting, corporate profits are withering and consumer and investor confidence is fragile The House legislation's center-piece is a package of corporate tax cuts that would total more than $70 billion this year The bill also includes $28 billion in tax cuts for individuals including one-time payments of $600 to couples and $300 to single people whose incomes were too low to receive rebate checks under the tax bill signed into law by President Bush this year and $12 billion to help states bolster programs for people who have lost jobs Under pressure from Democrats to explain their focus on companies rather than individuals.

""We needed at least a beginning on containing entitlements, argued Van Doom Ooms, research director of the Committee for Economic Development, and we didn't get it. pessimists. The buoyant economy has generated far more tax revenue than expected, while the accompanying decline in unemployment and welfare caseloads has reduced the cost of the social safety net.

Two months ago the Congressional Budget Office forecast that the deficit would equal 2 percent of the G.D.P. in 2002. In 2007 the office estimated that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid outlays would total 10.3 percent of G.D.P.

Too much of the energy of our citizens was directed toward seeking protection from future price increases and toward speculative activity, and too little toward production. Increasingly depressed and volatile capital markets reflected the uncertainties. Effective tax rates increased as inflation carried taxpayers into higher brackets.
